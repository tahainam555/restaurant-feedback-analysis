Sahudy,"Dined on December 2, 2024",5,EXCELENTE. LOS FIDEOS CON CHORIZO DIVINOS. EL CHURRASCO SABROSO Y EL PUDIN
Brian,"Dined on December 1, 2024",5,Everything about our dinner was wonderful from the greeting to dessert and all the deliciousness and service in between.
May,"Dined on December 1, 2024",4,"the food was so good but unfortunately I have to give it 3 stars because of the customer service. If this is going to be Michelin guide restaurant, I expect better services. We were driving from Boston & called to see if they extend our table 30 mins later because we were not expecting this much traffic & when we just wanted to CONFIRM if there’s a 24 hr policy, whoever picked up the phone call said “you should’ve done that yesterday” well if I knew traffic was this bad, maybe I should’ve seen the future!! that’s totally my fault for not knowing traffic. When we arrived around 4:34 (4:30 reservation) we had to wait 20 mins for our table, so it’s fair for you guys to tell us when to sit but can’t keep the same energy. Other than that, food was good but just not sure if the customer service was meeting - therefore Casa Ora in Brooklyn is better."
Adriana,"Dined on November 30, 2024",5,The food was delicious and the service was lovely.
Samara,"Dined on November 30, 2024",5,"Amazing food, amazing service. Mussels and meatballs were incredible and creative. Looking forward to going back and trying more things!"
Dan,"Dined on November 30, 2024",3,The food quality has gone down. The goat was dry and the croquettes were not that special. I was bummed as the last time I came it was an incredible Experience
Adam,"Dined on November 27, 2024",5,Unbelievable food and great atmosphere. Great venue for a really cool night out.
Raina,"Dined on November 26, 2024",5,Food was AMAZING but service was painfully slow. We had to signal to our server multiple times.
Mike,"Dined on November 26, 2024",5,"Amazing food, warm and delightful service, bustling atmosphere."
Blerim,"Dined on November 24, 2024",5,"First visit, awesome experience. Chef Diego, our Server, our Somm and the rest of the crew were great. Food was incredible, can’t wait to come back soon. Thank you for an amazing time."
Soni,"Dined on November 23, 2024",5,Excellent food & service.
Maya,"Dined on November 23, 2024",5,Amazing!!!! I love it there. Definitely my fav dinner spot
Piers,"Dined on November 20, 2024",4,Fabulous range of typically Spanish dishes. Good advice on the wine list.
Sandrine,"Dined on November 18, 2024",5,Great experience Excelent food Excelent service Recommended highly the place
Sharon,"Dined on November 18, 2024",5,Wonderful food and service! Like a mini trip to Spain.
christopher,"Dined on November 18, 2024",5,Encyclopedic Spanish wine list. Very experienced server.  Menu very focused menu with mostly seafood items.
Coni,"Dined on November 18, 2024",5,"The food, service and ambience were stellar, the bathroom was disgusting. Really disgusting."
John,"Dined on November 16, 2024",5,Everything was great. Food and service were excellent. Will definitely be back.
Lindsay,"Dined on November 16, 2024",5,"The sommelier was great! After we decided on food, she created a complementary set of pairings based on our preferences.  I appreciated how well everything was coursed. The goat was our favorite dish!  And the bread pudding was a fantastic end."
Andres,"Dined on November 15, 2024",4,"Good food and a great ambiance made for a nice evening, but the service fell short. After taking our order and bringing the wine bottle, the waiter never returned to pour more or check on us. No one asked how our food was or if we needed anything else until dessert."
Lei,"Dined on November 15, 2024",5,"Outstanding food and service. Cozy atmosphere; We were there for a special occasion, Definitely will go back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 15, 2024",5,Genuinely excellent seafood dishes. Ambiance was wonderful. Would go back in a heartbeat for a special occasion
Toni,"Dined on November 15, 2024",5,Food was delicious. Wine was great!  The vibe of the restaurant was cozy but festive. My favorite was the crudo and skirt steak. My husband’s favorite was the scallops and the burrata and squash. All was delicious. The service was attentive and fast but not rushing. Overall would totally recommend.
Alexandria,"Dined on November 14, 2024",5,Have been going here since it opened and it remains consistently excellent. Casa Mono salad is one of my favourite things!
Raúl,"Dined on November 13, 2024",5,Nothing short of outstanding meal and the service was impeccable.
Francisco,"Dined on November 13, 2024",4,"Excellent wine and atmosphere, food was a bit gimmicky. Croquettas were delicious, but the steak dish is terrible value for money, 1/4 steak 3/4 onion. The kitchen is obviously excellent, I just wish they would do one or two dishes a bit more traditionally."
Marieke,"Dined on November 12, 2024",3,"I was not convinced ! It’s definitely overrated and overpriced in my opinion. Yes, definitely some flavourful dishes, but you’ll find them in a regular restaurant in Spain for 1/4 of the price. The razor clams were tasty but had a lot of sand in them. We liked the burata but didn’t find it very special compared to other places serving this. We also liked the fluke crudo even though it was very small. Didn’t like the goat with avocado dish. The patatas bravas were very greasy and totally drenched in sauce. The bread pudding dessert wasn’t very convincing. The pulpo that we ordered never arrived (not sure if we paid for it: didn’t check). Overall I felt quite sick after the meal; probably from the greasy patatoes. Having dined in Michelin restaurants before, this one is definitely not worth a star. It’s a nice neighbourhood hang though and worth a try if you’re not able to go to Spain to get the same food for much less."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 11, 2024",5,You made my day Foods + wines + services Best place in NY
Cheryl,"Dined on November 11, 2024",5,My husband and I love Casa Mono and Bar Jamon. Food is consistently delicious and service consistently warm and hospitable. Deepest Spanish wine list in NYC. Excellent and friendly somm’s will always help you pick a great bottle. Truly our favorite restaurant in NYC!
Aleksandra,"Dined on November 10, 2024",4,"Amazing food, lovely place, but offering outside tables in November without heaters or even a blanket is not very customer friendly"
Mark,"Dined on November 9, 2024",4,"Had high expectations with the Michelin rating, and the definitely delivered. We had outside seating which was nice, but next time I would take the high top inside… the inside just had a more intimate feel. Best dish was the foie gras, a close second was the sous vide lamb, definitely get the desert. Great wine selection, even just the glass selections."
EdithL,"Dined on November 6, 2024",5,Great food !! Would come over again. The pork belly was exceptional
fred,"Dined on November 5, 2024",5,Wonderful.  Small venue. Great food and wine. Pre dinner bar is cool as well.
Rodrigo,"Dined on November 5, 2024",5,"Foo ñd was great, but the service was one of a kind."
Ahmad,"Dined on November 3, 2024",4,"The time for our dinner reservation was booked at 6:30 but we didn’t get table till 40 minutes after. We had to wait outside because bar was also full. Food was fair and I developed stomach pain at night, might be due to mushroom. Not a very good experience overall. Service was scrappy to say the least."
Joanne,"Dined on November 3, 2024",5,Excellent dishes one after the next.  Tiny spot but fun atmosphere.
Dan,"Dined on November 3, 2024",5,Wonderful as always. Only downside: seated outside and they no longer have heated outdoor structures. Got pretty chilly!
Jessie,"Dined on November 2, 2024",2,"Food is mediocre, not deserve the Michelin one star. we spent 90$ each person, but not even full after the meal"
Amy,"Dined on November 2, 2024",4,We love Casa Mono and continue to return! The restaurant always feels so cozy and warm and delicious. The combination of their deep red Spanish wine and their unique food is such a winner. I do find them quite expensive (like a lot of places in NYC right now ) considering the size of each small dish. But I still go back for their outstanding food combinations and flavors when I can!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 1, 2024",5,Casa Mono is my favorite restaurant in NYC. It never fails to surprise the palette and inspire the soul.
Kenneth,"Dined on October 25, 2024",5,A fantastic experience all around with exceptional food and service.
Francesca,"Dined on October 23, 2024",5,"We had an unforgettable dining experience where we put our full trust in the team to select our food and wine, and they exceeded every expectation. Andrew curated a mix of all-star dishes, alongside some underrated gems that completely blew us away. His recommendations were flawless, and his presence throughout the meal was the perfect balance of attentive and unobtrusive.  To elevate the evening even further, Juan Pablo’s wine and sherry pairings were spot-on, bringing out the best in each dish. His charm was contagious, adding a delightful energy to the meal. This was truly a standout experience from start to finish."
Review,"Dined on October 23, 2024",3,"Service was poor, and the food was disappointing compared to last year’s visit."
Barbara,"Dined on October 22, 2024",5,"Really incredible food. The burrata was one of the best dishes I’ve ever had the experience of enjoying. Also enjoyed the octopus, and skirt steak plates. Hope to return!"
GGSmith,"Dined on October 18, 2024",5,Amazing flavorful delicious meal. Great wine pairing suggestion from our server. Love the ambiance.
Wayne,"Dined on October 18, 2024",4,Would have been even better if we didn’t intially sit outdoors (but their outdoor heaters were delayed )
Luis,"Dined on October 17, 2024",5,An amazing establishment. The excellent selections of food & wines are never ending and constantly refreshed. A well deserved Michelin Star and superb service by the staff. A must when we visit NYC.
Gretchen,"Dined on October 17, 2024",4,Team - both wait staff and chef - showed great care managing some dietary limitations.
Jenna,"Dined on October 16, 2024",5,"We had a fantastic dinner here. Definitely listen to their recommendations, we were sceptical about the goat but it was 3/4's favourite dish. The waitstaff were very welcoming, and given how rich and luxurious everything tasted, the price was very reasonable."
Leslie,"Dined on October 15, 2024",2,Food was great but the host really soured our experience from the jump. I much prefer Bar Jamon—you can tell they're trying to rush you and get as much turnover as possible at Casa Mono.
Ermina,"Dined on October 14, 2024",5,So delicious- incredible food and service. A true gem.
Yennifer,"Dined on October 13, 2024",5,"Food was great, service could be a little better but would recommend 100%."
Andrew,"Dined on October 13, 2024",4,"food was very good, service was so so, waited a very long time for the menus and service was inattentive but it was busy so i understand."
William,"Dined on October 12, 2024",5,"Our favorite place, food, service, wine. Everything we like."
Kimberly,"Dined on October 11, 2024",5,"Amazing food and wine, great service and ambiance."
Fermanda,"Dined on October 10, 2024",5,"Los platos y la atención, simplemente, espectaculares."
Rodrigo,"Dined on October 8, 2024",5,The best in town. Unquestionable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
John,"Dined on October 7, 2024",4,Definitely a delicious spot for a tapas meal. Very eclectic clientele. Equally delightful menu.
Matthew,"Dined on October 4, 2024",5,Wonderful dining experience.  The food was delicious.  The service was absolutely outstanding!
suzanne,"Dined on October 3, 2024",5,"Inventive menu w/beautiful meat and fish dishes  but not lots for vegetarians…a great salad and burrata plate that is magnificent is on offer. Excellent wines as well. Small, intimate, good ambiance."
Kipp,"Dined on September 30, 2024",5,Great meal from start to finish. Sitting at the bar facing the kitchen was a fun experience. The Crispy Pig Ears were delicious and the glass of wine paired well with dinner. 10/10
Damon,"Dined on September 30, 2024",5,Great restaurant and service. A bit hard to find but the restaurant provides all of the direction detail prior to the reservation
Hector,"Dined on September 28, 2024",5,Comida exquisita. El cordero sobre todo y la ensalada con manchego
MaClayn,"Dined on September 27, 2024",5,Absolutely fantastic service.
Ruby,"Dined on September 26, 2024",5,"The fare, service and flavors were all excellent. It was a tight squeeze but it’s New York, so hey 👍🏽"
James,"Dined on September 26, 2024",5,Excellent and imaginative flavor combinations with a well-paired wine list and gracious service.
Lara,"Dined on September 25, 2024",5,Bryant was the best! The food was epic and I’m so happy
Bob,"Dined on September 23, 2024",5,"The food could not be better and our server, Isaias, added to our enjoyment of the dining experience."
Brian,"Dined on September 22, 2024",5,The goat was delicious !. The wine was excellent as was James . First time we were disappointed by a fish at CM but plan to be back !
Denise,"Dined on September 20, 2024",5,We come every year on our anniversary - amazing as always
Richard,"Dined on September 20, 2024",5,"I very much enjoyed our visit to Casa Mono. I especially liked the fact that many of my favorite dishes to find anywhere, are all available there and deliciously presented. I love Bone Marrow, Razor Vlams, Foie Gras, Duck and Crème Brûlée. To find them all at one place is a real treat!"
Geraldine,"Dined on September 19, 2024",4,"There’s a reason Casa Mono has been around so long!  The food is excellent, the service is attentive without being overbearing and there’s something for everyone.  Some standouts were the pulpo, the pork meatballs & the duck breast.  The server made great drink recommendations - with & without alcohol - (the phony Negroni was great!). Desserts were also good - the bread pudding was a favorite."
Niccolo,"Dined on September 18, 2024",5,I've been coming here 6 times a year for 8 years. that's all I have to say.
Sandra,"Dined on September 18, 2024",5,"A cozy, authentic Spanish restaurant.  The menu is exciting, expertly prepared with high quality products.  Our favorites included the pork Sobrasada with quince & honey and the scallops with Serrano pepper green curry & minted cashews.   Leave room for dessert!  The burnt vanilla custard with battered deep fried bay leaves is outstanding."
megan,"Dined on September 16, 2024",5,"Every single dish did not disappint, do flavorful ans unique!"
Evan,"Dined on September 15, 2024",5,Always a great experience sitting at the counter. Fun evening. Great wine choice by James.
Danielle,"Dined on September 15, 2024",5,"Food was great, but the wine the some recommended elevated the whole experience"
John,"Dined on September 14, 2024",5,This is my fourth or fifth time dining here and it never disappoints. Charming neighborhood gem with amazingly prepared Tapas and an excellent Spanish wine list to accompany the courses. Our server Darwin was outstanding with excellent knowledge of the food and wines and a fun engaging personality.
Byron,"Dined on September 8, 2024",5,Casa Mono has not lost its magic touch. The small kitchen prepares deservedly Michelin star plates to a packed house as effortlessly as the National Symphony Orchestra delivers the most passionate and stirring of melodies. We’ve never been disappointed and look forward to visiting when in Bew York.
Duncan,"Dined on September 7, 2024",5,Always hits the spot been going for 15 years plus amazing food and vibe this visit was no exception. Delicious
Jeanne,"Dined on September 6, 2024",5,"Casa Mono is always an experience, not just a meal.  We sat at the counter to have the opportunity to watch the kitchen staff do their magic.  The dishes were inventive and flavorful.  The wine list was magnificent and there were plenty of great options to choose from. Though our waiter was experienced, he didn't really explain any of the dishes and I felt pressured to make decisions without any assistance.  I ordered wine and he never came over to fill my wine glass when it was near empty.  At the end of the night I was having a sherry digestif and we planned to send the rest to the back because it was more than I could drink and he came over and dumped its contents into my glass.  It felt more like a push to get out the door.  We've been coming to Casa Mono since it opened but don't live in NYC anymore and hadn't been in years.  The overall feeling is still a very special and delicious experience, but it feels more like a machine and not a sweet neighborhood delight, at least compared to the past.  I would still return because of the food and the ambiance.  Overall, a great restaurant!"
Suzanne,"Dined on September 6, 2024",2,Requested outdoor seating and was placed very far outside next to a tree where dogs passed and used as a toilet.  The food was very disappointing.
Benjamin,"Dined on September 2, 2024",5,Great experience. took my wife for her bd. it was awesome
Robert,"Dined on September 1, 2024",2,"Honestly, I would avoid this place. The plates were advertised as small, but they were exceptionally, insultingly small. We ordered oxtail for example and there was such a small quantity of meat that we literally laughed. The beers cost 8 dollars and were only half filled. While the service was fine, the food was entirely too expensive and not at all authentic. I lived in Spain for years and I went with a Spaniard and we were all together unconvinced by this so-called “Spanish” food. The octopus was also more similar to what we would call in Spain chipirones. If you’re looking for authentic Spanish food in nyc I would definitely try another place."
Evan,"Dined on September 1, 2024",5,Great time sitting at the counter. Razor clams are always a must!
Marc,"Dined on August 31, 2024",5,Outstanding meal and excellent service. Great wine recommendation from sommelier.
ChristyB,"Dined on August 31, 2024",5,"Casa Mono was recommended to me by two different former Manhattan residents. Boy, it did not disappoint! We’ve had some fine meals in the US and Europe and this was in my husband’s Top 10 of all time. The service, to the food, to the vibe of the place - we loved everything about our experience. Our favorite dishes were the Pan can Tomate, Jamón Iberico, Fluke Crudo, and special duck liver pate."
Drlopezmdfacc,"Dined on August 30, 2024",5,"Must visit for elevated Spanish tapas experience. Pan de tomate, pulpo, jamon iberico, all well executed. Great wine list."
Andrew,"Dined on August 28, 2024",5,"What an incredibly special meal! We ordered heavy and every bite was delicious, nothing disappointed. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a fun and truly delectable meal."
Morg,"Dined on August 27, 2024",5,Lovely dining experience. Food and ambience was amazing!
Rafa,"Dined on August 25, 2024",4,Great Spanish tapas with a modern twist. Order the fluke crudo and definitely the scallops!
Kevin,"Dined on August 25, 2024",5,"Overall, great food and great value. A bit crowded, but not to the point it was not comfortable. My girlfriend and I celebrated her bday there, and all in all it was a positive experience. Service at times seemed rush with how they try to clear plates that you might want to hold on to for dipping bread into sauces, and would be nice if bottled cokes were chilled and not room temp (I do not appreciate a diluted coke over ice especially over a ‘heavy entree’), but all minor. Where we sat had a few flies or gnats that would linger around table. One managed to land in my drink and drown, but if you overlook that experience pretty good. Would recommend and would go back!"
Scott,"Dined on August 24, 2024",5,"I love this place - it’s an oldie but a goldie. Went there to celebrate my friend’s birthday - amazing food. Really friendly and professional staff - if I could afford it, I would go here much more often. Highly recommended:)"
lucia,"Dined on August 24, 2024",3,"As always, Casa Mono doesn't manage the tables correctly. Tables are always small and cramped.  I received a text message that my table was ready 15 minutes prior to my reservation and then when we were finishing our wine, the manager came over and said they needed the table.  You always feel rushed.  Years ago, if the table was needed, management would welcome people to the bar to buy guests a drink or allow to finish your bottle at the bar.  It's never a pleasant setting.  The food is always amazing and consistent for the past 20 years.  I also found it disappointing that the Sommelier didn't even know Italian Wine Merchants, which I believe the original investors (including Joe Biastanich) in Casa Mono and Babbo invested in.  The waiter, Darwin, was personable and great. The razor clams which weren't available my last visit, were as delicious and unique as always.  Too bad the seppie are no longer offered on the menu.  The skirt steak, excellent as always.  Duck breast was cooked to perfection and very tender."
Ben,"Dined on August 22, 2024",5,Food is terrific. An incredible experience. Can’t speak highly enough. Servers rushed us which was a surprise
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 21, 2024",5,Couldn’t have asked for a memorable dining experience. Everyone from front to the back of house made it a day we will never forget. Compliments to the chefs and to all of casa mono!! Counting down the days to our next visit!!
David,"Dined on August 21, 2024",5,"Phenomenal meal. Our waiter was very helpful answering questions we had about the menu. We had 5 dishes and each was amazing. The highlights for us were the skirt steak, duck egg, crispy pig ears, and burrata. So pretty much everything we ate. Great atmosphere and service, and reasonably priced, you can spend a lot or a little depending on what you're looking for. Highly recommend."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 17, 2024",5,Truly loved this restaurant!! Counter seating was the best and the food was unreal. Absolutely adored this spot
LuisG,"Dined on August 16, 2024",5,"What an outstanding experience! Food, environment and service were taking to another level! Amazing job Benoit! You deserve a 🌟"
Sebastian,"Dined on August 16, 2024",5,Great food and a generous helping of wine per glass!
Selina,"Dined on August 16, 2024",4,"Second time here and more familiar with the menu so we’re happier with our choices.  Restaurant is extremely pestering with being on time with email reminders and text msgs.  Description of menu items needs to be better explained for those who are not familiar with Spanish food terms, ingredients and spices.  Staff likes to get order all at once so not easy for first timer and only a little better for second timer.  Difficult to gauge what order the food will be served.  Service is adequate and only had to ask for more bread once.  Once food is all on the table, staff is constantly coming around to pour wine and to check if dishes can be taken away, definitely feel like being rushed.  Since this is our second time, we are not shy at telling the staff NO.  The restaurant was quite full so the noise level was not good.  We skipped dessert because we felt being rushed and gave back the table within an hour of the reservation."
Conrad,"Dined on August 15, 2024",5,"Table location problem was immediately resolved.  Manager Danielle Pappas made absolutely certain that we were well served, and that our food orders were promptly cooked and served.  Danielle patiently explained the nuances in the dishes on the menu.  We will return!"
Onute,"Dined on August 14, 2024",5,"*Sensational blend of unexpected, but stellar flavors in every dish. Each one was a marvel: a virtual taste explosion of pure delight! We were 2 diners: ordered 5 dishes. The only negative was wanting to try more menu items despite being fully satiated. *Service was ideal: truly attentive (not intrusive), friendly, meticulous. *Sommelier: made an ideal wine suggestion (after several clear questions to make his recommendation). *Noise level was high, but (to us) indicated everyone’s revelry @ enjoying such unusual excellence in every combination. Fun vibe.  Perfect: We’ll return frequently & very often!"
PaulS,"Dined on August 12, 2024",5,"Smart, tasty and quite innovative food in a Spanish brasserie style setting. Fun watching the open kitchen from bar seats, but overall can get noisy. The originality and quality of the food make it well worth a repeat visit"
Michele,"Dined on August 11, 2024",5,Enjoyed a lovely lunch outdoors. As always!!! Started with the Casa Mono salad. So refreshing!!! Then had a small filet of fluke atop abed of black rice and a lovely green and creamy sauce. Finally a delicious pork belly and some delicious bone marrow… Yumm! Good thing we planned a LONG WALK along the Rast River after that beautiful and very TASTY lunch!!!
Jacob,"Dined on August 11, 2024",1,Terrible experience here. Had to leave the restaurant because server would not even attempt to accommodate a gluten allergy. Basically said you can eat the salads. I have never heard of not being able to eat the meat/seafood at a restaurant due to a gluten allergy.
Daniel,"Dined on August 10, 2024",5,"An awesome experience from start to finish.  Over the past twenty years, everything has remained delightful and delicious.  Thank you."
Ian,"Dined on August 8, 2024",4,"Host sat us at a two-top next the only other parties in the place, also two-tops, when the rest of the small restaurant, consisting of three 4-tops, was empty on a slow weekday afternoon at 2pm.  When asked if we could be seated at one of the more comfortable tables, host said she wasn’t allowed.  After the meal, I suggested to the floor manager that she should give away the 4s when the place was empty, it’s just unfriendly not to. She agreed, expressing surprise that we were denied after asking.  Also the waiter upsold us on the wine, but the bottle (a red) was quite chilled when he brought it over so I declined, in favor a a more modest wine that he had a room temperature.  Not a fan of chilled red wine. He seemed a bit annoyed.  Food and food service were lovely."
Lynn,"Dined on August 5, 2024",5,"We went on a whim because we live nearby. We were so pleasantly surprised by the extraordinary food and dining experience. The dishes were all gorgeous and the staff was very competent and pleasant. I can’t recommend Casa Mono enough, and I can’t wait to go back."
IntolerantDiner,"Dined on August 5, 2024",5,Absolutely delicious! Excellent service for both food and great advice from the sommelier. We had black rice with fluke and an amazing green sauce; then we had sautéed mushrooms and garlic which we always have and it was fabulous. Then we had foi gras with à honey sauce from Jerez and we had the lamb belly; also yummy. We finished with creamy pineapple sorbet. We love Casa Mono and will return next time we are in the big Apple.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 5, 2024",5,"Phenomenal food and excellent service. Recommend going with a large group to try most dishes on the menu - all are incredible. While not cheap, this is great value for money and worth every penny."
Thomas,"Dined on August 4, 2024",5,"Casa Mono never fails to impress on every level; friendly, knowledgeable service, charming ambiance, and truly brilliant food and wine."
Jessica,"Dined on August 4, 2024",5,Absolutely amazing food and fantastic service!!!! Our reservation was running behind due to a rain storm but we were sat at the sister wine bar and given great care & a free appetizer until our table was ready
HKDiner,"Dined on August 4, 2024",5,"Pan con tomate, burrata, crudo, duck, sausage w honey, creme Catalan, and chocolate were amazing. Wine, sherry fantastic.  Staff are great.  Was the  pulpo supposed  to be crispy and flat?  Only miss of the night.  Would return in a second!!"
natalie,"Dined on August 3, 2024",5,"Warm reception, always. Fantastic as always!! Service great, food great! We love everything about this restaurant."
Daisy,"Dined on August 1, 2024",5,"Really fancy and nice tapas, had a chef's experience seating and watching them cooking is very enjoyable"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 31, 2024",5,"I have never had an unpleasant experience here, and every dish I have eaten is extraordinary. The food is exceptional, the service is exceptional, the ambience is exceptional."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 30, 2024",5,Very good restaurant with exciting food small cosy place
ArielD,"Dined on July 30, 2024",4,"Service was fantastic, waitstaff were friendly and always check on us if we need anything.  Our favorite was foie gras, duck breast and bread pudding with ice cream !"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 28, 2024",1,"Food wasn’t great and it was very upsetting. Additionally, the wine that was recommended was not at all what we had described we wanted"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 28, 2024",3,"The decor at Casa Mono exuded a cozy ambiance, a pleasant environment for diners. The service was good with attentive and patient waitstaff. Our orders included pork belly, razor clams, Jamón Ibérico and others. The pork belly, while deep-fried, had a gamey aftertaste, necessitating the use of additional sauce to mask the flavor. The razor clams still contained residual grains of sand, which compromised their springy texture.The standout dish was the pig ear. The fried pork ear was immersed in a slightly sour sauce, and the addition of yellow peaches enriched overall sweetness of the dish."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 27, 2024",3,"Service and ambiance are great. Skirt steak was overcooked, no flavor. Duck breast and sobreasada are the best."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 26, 2024",4,"Good food, good service but the price was extremely expensive."
LillianA,"Dined on July 25, 2024",5,"Favorite restaurant in NYC! Never dissapoints, highly recommend it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 24, 2024",2,"Food is ok, but not worth it. Service is fair. Place is super loud and vibe is ok"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 22, 2024",5,Excellent food. Tapas were very inventive. I will definitely return
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 21, 2024",3,Average and overpriced food. Took over an hour to get our order and that was at 2pm when it wasn't that busy.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 21, 2024",5,Food and service are always exceptional. Key items to not miss: - razor clams - eggs and uni - oxtails and peppers
Megablito,"Dined on July 20, 2024",3,"Food was average or just above average when compared to a good tapas place in Spain (Madrid, Salamanca or Barcelona). Had a total of 12 orders, so we tried almost all popular tapas. Razor clams, jamon iberico de bellota, fluke ceviche. The bread was not freshly baked (chewy). Will not go back unfortunately. Michelin star wrongly granted."

Kinka,"Dined on July 19, 2024",5,A great service great ambience in the obviously great food you’re going to see on your table the orders you placed will not look like anything you really eaten before and that you were super super food. He really enjoyed tasting all the different dishes.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 18, 2024",5,"Amazing food. Came with 4 guests had about 8 plates, plenty of food. My favorite restaurant in the city hands down."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 17, 2024",5,Every bite is memorable. You can’t go wrong at casa mono!
ali39,"Dined on July 16, 2024",5,"Everything we had was delicious, and the service was excellent. Highly recommend"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 15, 2024",1,"The pulpo was not a pulpo but squids also unsalted and flavorless, the black rice was extremely oily and the only flavor that you could taste was cilantro; the skirt steak was cold and rubbery the only I think we liked was the trio of sorbets. Definitely not a michelin star restaurant, disappointed our expectations."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 13, 2024",5,Darwin is the best server we have ever had in NY. Please give him a raise and promotion ASAP!!!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 12, 2024",5,Outstanding food quality and originality. Great service and friendly staff.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 9, 2024",5,Great food and service! Can’t wait to come back! Ps: loved the pouring amount of a glass of wine
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 8, 2024",4,"Food was good, unfortunately they were sold out of the main dish we came for which was the razor clam. As well, it was very warm inside, only slightly better than what it was outside and it was very humid outside. Being that the restaurant is very small, they need better cooling."
dlover,"Dined on July 8, 2024",5,If you like to enjoy several plates with small group of people it is perfect place. Food is amazing and wine options are good too
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 7, 2024",5,"The restaurant was loud. Other than that, the service was intimate and very attentive. The food was fresh and the flavors exploded in your mouth. All in all, a great spot. I will return the next time I’m in New York."
MisterStars,"Dined on July 7, 2024",5,"Casa Mono is a very special place with amazing people, great food, and an amazing wine list."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 4, 2024",2,"Overrated and very poor services, waiter isn’t nice very impatient the table was dripping with AC water."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 3, 2024",2,"We have high expectations upon doing there for dinner, but we're pretty disappointed with the food. Overall, the food was very salty and definitely nothing to write home about. We ordered 11 items off the menu and I would say only three of them were reasonably good."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 3, 2024",5,"Wonderful sommelier! Tapas were very good, especially razor clams."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 1, 2024",5,"pig ears, membrillo, sweet tomatoes & cheese, sidra. what a place.... you will fall in love with"
RodneyH,"Dined on June 30, 2024",5,Loved the overall dining experience. Food flavors were outstanding
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 30, 2024",2,"I'm SHOCKED that they have a Michelin star! The fluke crudo was marvelous, but every other dish disappointed. Burrata and octopus with no flavor (pea pesto bland, fennel and grapefruit bland). Lamb was soft and well-cooked but lacked any flavor. Skirt steak was fine but unremarkable. Razor clams were tasty but that's because butter and garlic are tasty. Not worth it. The bone marrow, however, was shockingly bad. Bone marrow is inherently unctuous rich and flavorful, but this was lumpy, oily, and tasteless except for the crema and fish roe which masked the flavorlessness but added an unpleasantly dissonant taste. Even the toast triangles were over-buttered, as if that would salvage them.  WORSE, service was bad. They didn't come enough to even get us to order more beer/wine! Their wine recommendation felt random and tasted Meh. There were large gaps with no food. No refilling of water or bread offered. Finally, the bathroom was just terrible. Tiny, with no room for the inevitable line of people, but inside it was repulsive. Wet paper towels piled on the garbage can and wet on the floor. Toilet that was likely clean but not sparkling enough to inspire confidence. We sat outside and had a lovely street view experience (despite the visiting rat!), but inside it was tight, hot, and loud. Some might have liked the inside, actually, but probably no one would give the bathroom a pass. The menu, be forewarned, is only in Spanish. Fair enough (though imagine that at a Chinese or Indian restaurant), but the table next to us had several foreign visitors and it caused confusion and embarrassment. The server answered questions but not with enough energy or clarity to help--it was minimal. I'm really just amazed that this place has been open so long, let alone that it has a Michelin star."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 30, 2024",5,Sat on the sidewalk. Great experience. Food was excellent and the Fois Gras may be the best dish we have ever had.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 28, 2024",5,Phenomenal time. Bit pricey tho. Pay to play is worth it here
Port,"Dined on June 28, 2024",2,Greeters were unwelcoming.  Not going back.  Food was ok. Server was decent.
SeaCruz,"Dined on June 26, 2024",5,"Thank you all for our first time at Casa Mono, but not our last time. See you soon."
downtowner,"Dined on June 26, 2024",2,"We have been diners at Casa Mono since the night it opened.  We were very disappointed  with our recent lunch.  The sweetbreads were soaking in oil.  The duck breast was 2 mini slices.  The pork belly was so tough as to be inedible.  The 2 other courses  were, at best, fair. We would no longer recommend this restaurant."
DJMF,"Dined on June 26, 2024",5,"Food and service was excellent. Bone Marrow, Confit Goat, and Paella Croqueta were the stand out dishes and the sommelier suggested an excellent Catalan Rosado. Tables are very tightly squeezed together and it is quite loud but the vibe is lively without being pretentious. We will definitely come back."
AndrewD,"Dined on June 25, 2024",5,"Casa Mono was incredible. Great service, food was fantastic with unique and incredibly balanced dishes. Would absolutely come back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 25, 2024",5,"Rich choice, excellent meals, very helpful service. Great value for money. The street seating area is a bit noisy, but we booked late and there were no tables inside."
OCYelper,"Dined on June 25, 2024",4,"Had been wanting to come here again for a long time. Not as good and charming as I remembered. Service was lackluster. Our server was pretty disengaged and did not come for quite awhile and did not check on us during the meal. The tapas was good but the prices are ridiculous for tapas. Having just come from St. Sebastian, Spain where they have a lot Michelin star rated restaurants for such a small city, Casa Mono is good but not worthy of the price. I got the nostalgia out of my system. No need to come back."
CarlosM,"Dined on June 25, 2024",5,"An excellent experience, food, wine selection and staff!"
Louise,"Dined on June 25, 2024",5,We ate outside. Food was delicious. Very inventive.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 24, 2024",5,"Recommended by a former nyc chef and acquaintance as his favorite place to “send people .” It was perfect in every way. Coming from Portland Oregon, it’s tough to impress with food. This was a wonderful experience altogether. Highly recommend"
michelllew,"Dined on June 24, 2024",4,Great food and service/ slightly disappointed there were no cocktails but excellent wines
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 23, 2024",4,"We had a good time with good food and drink, and services."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 23, 2024",4,"Not your typical Michelin star restaurant. To start with, the price point is lower, and the decor won't be confused with Le Bernadin, but the staff is friendly and attentive. Most importantly, the food is to die for. My best meal in months. Had a nice Albarino , although the prices on the wines are not the best, though it is more than a glass worth.  I think i ate here years ago when it was under Mario Batali. The entire experience is greatly improved since those days. . Highly recommended."
rebekahG,"Dined on June 22, 2024",5,"It’s manhattan, so it’s pricey, but so worth it! Highly recommended."
HuyT,"Dined on June 21, 2024",4,Food was good but not insanely good!  Service was great.  Some dishes were misses. Came for the razor but no razor…
anita,"Dined on June 18, 2024",5,Always fabulous.  the food is first-rate and presented beautifully.  The wine recommendation was perfect.  Staff attentive and not intrusive.  One of my all-time favorite NYC restaurants.  A gem.
DavidD,"Dined on June 18, 2024",5,Specatcular food. The lamb was the best I ever had.
Joni,"Dined on June 17, 2024",5,"We were warmly welcomed by the hostess and sent to the bar to wait for our table where we were served by a nice young man. The food was spectacular, the ambiance a bit rowdy but entertaining. Our server, Lyla could not have been more accommodating had we been dining in her own home. She’s wonderful! Great place!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 16, 2024",3,"The food here is so great with some classic items, but mostly inventive twists on tapas. The food presentation was sooo beautiful! The only thing was it is pretty loud and the tables are super close together, but that's nyc I suppose. The only thing that really was odd was we were perfectly on time for the reservation, but didn't even get water or service for maybe 10-15 mins? Would love to come back on a calmer night, and this place is on the perfect street in nyc, that is sometimes tranquil. Will be back and hoping the service is a little better next time."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 16, 2024",5,Lovely complexity to the flavors. Unusual items on small plates. Excellent service and moderately priced. I'll be back and will recommend Casa Mono to friends.
Kramer,"Dined on June 16, 2024",3,"Probably was just bad night in a Michelin Star restaurant and I had the bad luck to be there that day, but I’ve never seen croquetas with the appearance that one of the 4 was burned out in rancid oil and I ask myself how can any restaurant allowed that to get to the table. The truth is that none of the plates from the left page of the menu were impressive and I could say subpar ( octopus, Pan con Tomate and of course the Croquetas) the plates on the Right Page of the Menu were pretty good and if you happen to go there just stick to it (the right side of the menu), the Oxtail plate and the Pork Sobrasada are outstanding. The Wine list is Very Complete with a ton of options from different Spanish’s regions wich i loved. Plus the sommelier is really helpful. No complains with the deserts and sweet Wine list even though the waitress kept pointing to the most expensive ones when ask for a recommendation  at least that was the impression  of the ppl in my table. Lastly when the check came we observe they charged us for the Bread that we never ask for and thought it was house courtesy as many restaurant does if you don’t ask for it. I don’t use to do reviews like many regular ppl don’t. But like me many regular folks read what other ppl experienced before taking a decision and that’s why I think it was important to write this one."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 15, 2024",5,"Wonderful experience!  Food, service, wine was all wonderful!"
lamedoc,"Dined on June 14, 2024",4,"So loud. As in, 85 dB on my meter. Food was phenomenal; service was excellent. But my ears were still ringing 10 minutes after leaving the restaurant."
R0d1905,"Dined on June 11, 2024",5,Michelin Star Restaurant exceeding expectations! Cozy atmosphere highlighting amazing tapas Can’t go wrong for a special occasion or a business meal bringing the best authentic Spanish cuisine
Katie,"Dined on June 10, 2024",5,"One of the best dinners we’ve had in the city.  The scallops with serrano curry were the absolute highlight of the meal. Truly the best scallop dish I’ve ever had. The duck was a close second. Razor clams were also great but in a basic butter/garlic/herb sauce - which was great but flavors that I have tasted at many other places. So get them, but don’t skip the other stuff!  We had our server pick our food and wine pairings and she did a great job."
Kevala,"Dined on June 8, 2024",5,Great food and service.  The scallops are fantastic!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 7, 2024",4,"My husband and I enjoyed very much our lunch at Casa Mono.   The Jamón Pata Negra was outstanding.  Our table was outdoors in the shade, so no problem with extreme heat or sunshine."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 7, 2024",5,"Absolutely loved every dish we got. The Fluke Crudo is a must, I could drink the sauce. Same with the Pan con Tomate and Skirt Steak. Get the Pazo Señorans Alberiño if you want a light white wine"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 7, 2024",4,"This was our third time at Casa Mono. We love this restaurant. The food is always amazing and our server was helpful and friendly. We hope to keep returning.  With this in mind, we do have some criticism. Firstly, I tried to cancel on open table more than 24 hours prior to the reservation. Open table would not allow me. I was at work and unable to call to cancel until the evening prior. I explained this to them and they said they would charge me $50 a person to cancel. I understand why they have this rule in place but they would not budge, even when I explained. We weren't a no show. We are repeat customers. I feel like they should have been more flexible. So we made it work. We showed up. We booked outside but the weather was uncomfortable. They were booked inside, which I understood so we opted for the bar. Except the air conditioning wasn't on and it was very hot by the stoves. So we asked to move outside. There was no one sitting outside at all but instead of the host offering to seat us under an awning, she offered us a table on the corner by the crosswalk and near a puddle. I had to ask to sit under an awning.  This restaurant is great but there is an attitude they have that WE should be grateful to be there instead of the other way around."
Gene,"Dined on June 4, 2024",5,"Great and interesting menu. Excellent preparation and presentation. Inventive. Fine wine list.Excellent service. Depending on weather, seating may be air-conditioned or open air whether inside or out."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 2, 2024",5,"Having been to Casa Mono on more than a few occasions, I am happy to report that the quality of its appetizers and entrees remains high.  We had savory pulpo a la plancha, mussels with chorizo, and sardines as appetizers before enjoying duck breast, grilled skirt steak, and pork meatballs, all of which were served in a timely manner by an attentive wait staff.  We completed these dishes with a 2012 Lopez and Heredia Rioja.  I recommend Casa Mono with enthusiasm!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 31, 2024",5,Best experience ever! Wine was beautiful and tapas were out of this world!
TimothyB,"Dined on May 30, 2024",2,they do not allow corkage for wine from the outside. most of their bottles were priced way high. this restaurant had wines $1000 to $5000 per bottle. totally ridiculous. I would not return.
JChilton,"Dined on May 28, 2024",5,"This lively restaurant pulses with energy, making it perfect for a fun night out. The exceptional food includes standout tapas dishes like the succulent goat confit and crispy croquettes. They have an excellent, inexpensive wine list with spot-on recommendations from the staff. With its energetic atmosphere, delicious tapas, and great wines, this is a must-visit."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 27, 2024",5,Favorite restaurant in the world. Not sure why this app has a minimum # of characters.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 26, 2024",2,"Casa mono was very accommodating on reservation change request & food was presented well & yummy however,  low score given due to service. Staff was impeccably rude regarding requests & constantly seemed annoyed that we were requesting basic things like small plates , napkins , salt & pepper , a second coke & water with ice. We were given 1 receipt as final bill  & then charged something different on the machine which if we had not asked about price variance we would not have been advised reason for being charged more than the bill.   Staff needs some retraining on hospitality & small bathroom needs to be maintained cleaner & stocked with toilet paper."

StefS,"Dined on May 20, 2024",5,Our server was absolutely incredible. Every dish was delicious and perfectly cooked. An overall wonderful experience!
MimiNYC,"Dined on May 19, 2024",5,"Although my friend arrived almost 15 minutes late, we were able to keep our reservation — that was the start of a genuinely near perfect meal. The Fidelos (angela hair with shockles and garlic sauce) were “life changing” as my friend said after having them for the first. The skirt steak (the one blip of the night) came under cooked just shy of medium rare in spots. We asked for it to be cooked just a little bit more to true medium rare but got nearly well done. Okay for my friend, lost its flavor for me. Our meal was rounded out by Pulpo and Barrata - both delicious! Overall an amazing meal."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 19, 2024",5,Great food!  Brought back memories of our trip to Barcelona and all the great food!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 18, 2024",1,Giving it overall only one star as I made the reservation a month previously for a birthday dinner at 6 pm and the first thing the hostess said to us as we entered was they needed the table by 8 pm for another reservation!!!! Excuse me.. how insulting. I said of course but it ruined the experience for us all. Won’t be back

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 10, 2024",5,Razor clams were amazing. The scallops could have been bigger but they tasted great.
Lotte,"Dined on May 9, 2024",1,"The delicious food always brings me back to Casa Mono, but time and time again, it never fails to surprise me how unpleasant the hosts seem to be. While the wait staff is always hospitable and delightful, the hosts seem to enjoy being inhospitable to guests with and without reservations. It was disappointing to see that the host during my most recent experience, sat Asian guests in a tucked away corner. It’s tiring to see this form of racial discrimination in 2024."
bpsf,"Dined on May 8, 2024",5,"Always a treat.  Great food, cordial staff offering great service."
bayareares,"Dined on May 8, 2024",4,"Excellent tapas. Very busy place. We definitely felt like we were rushed out of there, despite buying lots of food and 2 bottles of wine for just 4 people. Also, had to wave at servers before getting attention. For over $500 for 4, for tapas, maybe service can be enhanced."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 6, 2024",5,"Excellent service , delicious tapas, the octopus and the bone marrow are amazing !"

I can’t recommend Casa Mono highly enough.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 25, 2024",5,"Ate in the outdoor seating! Food and drinks were good and service was quick, if not a bit rushed at the end as they needed to accommodate another reservation. Inside, it is a bit noisier and more compact."
SeanB,"Dined on April 25, 2024",4,"I wished I loved it - but the food just wasn’t as stellar as expected. Service was excellent, however.  Fairly pricey for some pretty standard tapas. $20 for pan con tomate? Pork belly was incredible.  Just not enough to bring us back unfortunately."
AmyD,"Dined on April 23, 2024",5,"We really love the food and wine and ambience at Casa Mono and we keep coming back!  Really delicious, fresh and interesting flavors.  Only downsides:  dishes are very meat-heavy (awesome dishes but a little too much meat), and the prices are definitely quite high for dishes that are basically ""appetizer-size"" or a little bigger---for almost entree prices."

MichelleE,"Dined on April 21, 2024",5,"We had an exceptional time at Casa Mono. The food was great; service and assistance in wine pairing was warm and spot on. Even more importantly, for us, it was a really laid back and fun experience. We hope to return next time in NYC."
neontapir,"Dined on April 20, 2024",5,The server and sommalier guided us through the menu and made it an unforgettable experience!
frequentdiner,"Dined on April 18, 2024",4,"Very creative tapas, but it is difficult to enjoy a meal in such tight quarters when a waiter or busboy is coming by every few seconds to try to clear the table while you eat.  We had an early reservation (5:15 PM) so it is not as if they had to turn the table around quickly. The check arrived, without our asking for it, while I was finishing my wine."
AndrewM,"Dined on April 17, 2024",5,Really great restaurant. The interior is very cute and almost cozy/rustic. Food was excellent. Only complaint is that the food came way too fast. We ordered like 9 things and it was a group of 4 people and we were in and out in a little over an hour. They would bring 4-5 dishes at once which was a bit overwhelming. I’d come back for sure and just ask them to slow it down a bit
AriS,"Dined on April 15, 2024",5,"Highly recommend, one of the better restaurants in nyc."
humtai,"Dined on April 13, 2024",4,"I’ve been coming for years to Casa Mono. While the food he maintained consistency, the price-to-value equation has materially deteriorated in two ways. First, there are fantastic tapas options available and post-Covid, the Spanish restaurant segment has new alternatives. Second, the dishes are very good but not great. I think folks are the Michelin star and feel the dishes are elevated—but to me, they are very good but not great."
QueenCuisine,"Dined on April 13, 2024",5,The food was delicious as usual. We love sitting at the bar. The young woman cooking was so much fun to watch! The service was okay.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 12, 2024",3,"Great wine, desserts, and 5/10 of the tapas we ordered were great. Service was a bit slow."
AnaliC1,"Dined on April 8, 2024",5,Amazing food and wines!!
Luis,"Dined on April 7, 2024",4,"Our server was great and the energy/vibe of the very small space is great. Appreciate the good selection of wines - but quite pricey. Not too many options for a group that may have more than one bottle. The food was alright - our highlight was the delicious bone marrow and the foie gras. Really great! Our bacalao croquettes were not as great as could be, nor was the octopus. The squid in ink was very good. So, in general - mixed feelings on the food, especially for some staples that one would expect would be perfect in a Spanish venue."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 7, 2024",5,"Everything was amazing! (we had 2 apps, 6 shareable entrees, 2 desserts) - highly recommended!"
DJMXX,"Dined on April 7, 2024",5,We absolutely loved every dish (too numerous to list so I assume everything is at the same high level).  The service was friendly and was at the perfect level of attentiveness. The ambiance is casual and relaxed. We ate outside on a cool night and were quite comfortable. The wines were well served by the very knowledgeable sommelier.  I can’t recommend Casa Mono enough and look forward to returning in the nearest future.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 7, 2024",5,Dining at Casa Mono is always a great pleasure. The food was excellent and the sommelier did a great job helping us select the wine.

SeksomS,"Dined on April 2, 2024",4,Excellent tapas and drinks selection.   Charming space in a delightful neighborhood.   It felt a little rushed and overly structured at times.   But I think the intention to deliver a food experience was there
JordynnM,"Dined on March 30, 2024",5,Wonderful experience! Our sever recommended a handful of dishes and wine to accompany and it was all fantastic!
Tubbs,"Dined on March 29, 2024",5,"Absolutely phenomenal! Every single dish was so delicious, excellently cooked and presented beautifully. The wine chosen for us was perfect. We loved this place!"
TinaG,"Dined on March 26, 2024",5,"Delicious food! Didn’t have a bad bite the whole meal. We had the burrata, black rice, skirt steak, duck breast, croqueta with prawns, shishito peppers and finished off with crema catalana. Each dish was balanced beautifully. There were 3 of us and the waiter recommended 6 to 9 dishes. We went with 6 and it was plenty for us although if some of us had been hungrier we probably would’ve needed 7 or 8. The wait staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful. Lovely evening!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 26, 2024",5,Best hidden gem in nyc.  Rare yet approachable food with casual / upscale vibe
Pontxo,"Dined on March 26, 2024",4,"The food is excellent. The service is lacking—definitely below average, but not horrible. The place is small and too tight. Not very comfortable."
GraceS,"Dined on March 23, 2024",2,Food was not good at all. Best item was bread………..
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 20, 2024",5,Fantastic. Great service. Great food. Altogether perfect.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 20, 2024",5,The food was really good and cute environment! The squid ink dish and the pork were amazing.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 18, 2024",4,We had the black rice and it was very good. The sweetbreads were different and also good. We’ll be back next tome in NY.
Lily,"Dined on March 18, 2024",5,"Excellent food, ambiance reminding me of local spots in Barcelona. Our server recommended 6 courses to share amongst my husband and I. We ordered 5 and dessert. My husband isn't as adventurous when it comes to seafood or fish. So we ordered the burrata, patatas bravas, skirt steak, razor clams, prawns and risotto croquette.  Highly recommend the skirt steak, so tender and atop an excellent romesco. I savored the razor clams, light buttery garlicky lemon. If we were to do again I'd skip the patatas and burrata and focus more on the other savories. We finished with a chocolate ganache was so rich creamy, cold and light. Perfect ending. Adding to our must visit stops in NYC in the future!"
Banfi,"Dined on March 16, 2024",3,Food was ok won’t go back - everything had an abnormal amount of mayo.
Rini,"Dined on March 16, 2024",5,"The food was exceptional, the wine list extensive! looking forward to returning!"
smithmuniz,"Dined on March 15, 2024",5,"My fav restaurant in New York City, intimate and innovative interpretations of Spanish food, multi-layered with exquisite flavors that linger like fine wine. Not an everyday treat but each visit is bound to be memorable and worth the expense. Go with a date, go with best friends, go by yourself and sit at the counter and banter with the cooks. Enjoy the crowd. Enjoy the moment. And enjoy the wine."
GeorgeH,"Dined on March 15, 2024",5,"The food is fantastic. It was all excellently executed. The staff were friendly and helpful. It is a small space, so it is not quiet dining, so keep that in mind."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 9, 2024",4,"The food and ambience were great! However, the host was not friendly and the waiting staff was not as attentive - we had to ask for menus twice."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 9, 2024",4,We had nice dining experience but service was quite disappointed compared to previous visit. Food was a little bit cold.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 6, 2024",5,"We did not order, but simply asked the chef to through on the table what they believe are the best, and they are amazing! We walked in very hungry and 3.5 hours later, walked out very full and super satisfied. What an experience, highly recommend."
chait,"Dined on March 4, 2024",5,"Excellent dinner and service, every dish was a hit and I look forward to come again"
Neel,"Dined on March 4, 2024",5,Layla (spelling?) was amazing. Food was outstanding as well. Highly recommend.
Allie,"Dined on March 3, 2024",3,Good food. Been year once before during Covid. The policies and host are ridiculous. Host didn’t seat us when 2 out of 3 of the party arrived. Kept reminding us what time we had to leave. Then sat us in the worst table that was in front of the waiters station. I asked to switch and they said “ another party of 4 would needed that table” even though we were already at a table of 4! The wait staff was nice. I just think that whole experience ruined it. Will never go back.
Kris,"Dined on March 1, 2024",5,There is no better place for Spanish food in NYC.
David,"Dined on March 1, 2024",5,"Amazing flavours, great service, solid wine list, excellent location, this restaurant is superb. All that and it's still casual, which we love."
Sara,"Dined on February 29, 2024",4,"I went there for a business lunch, and the setting by the window in the winter is nice & warm in the winter. Food is fantastic! Only minor improvement I'd suggest would be to tone down the complexity of the bone marrow dish; it was hard to take the favor of the marrow with the yogurt (looking) sauce, spiciness of the onion and pungent flavor of the (salmon?) roes on top. All 7 dishes we tried were delicious! Waiter suggestion on the goat confit was so worth it! I wish we had a bigger table for all the dishes we ordered, but the service was mostly prompt to refresh the table. Will be back again with hubby next time."
ChrisD,"Dined on February 28, 2024",5,"Great place, one of our favorites. The lamb belly is 11/10."
Chanukha,"Dined on February 26, 2024",5,Mark of a good restaurant in my opinion is how consistent is.  Some high flying names after catching the popular wave inevitably decline but Casa Mono is consistently good through the years. Really enjoyed all the dishes. Small cosy ambiance was perfect for niece’s birthday who’s graduating from college this year.  Great treat.
DanaP,"Dined on February 25, 2024",5,Everything was outstanding - loved the help from the Sommelier. Thank you!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 25, 2024",4,The food was amazing. We did have to wait an additional 30 minutes from our reservation and got seated at nearly 9:30/10 pm which is much later than we intended.
AROV,"Dined on February 25, 2024",3,We sat outside and there were delays in service. Several waiters came to attend us for the duration of the meal. We found the food too garlicky in comparison to previous visits. This was not our best visit.
MelG,"Dined on February 23, 2024",5,Amazing original delicious tapas!!! Felt like we were in Spain
ArthurB,"Dined on February 22, 2024",4,"This is a quality restaurant. The food is excellent! Small plates are not my favorite way of dining, but, our dinner worked out very well. Service, is professional, and friendly and welcoming. Ambiance is casual and a bit rustic. We liked it a lot!"
Angie,"Dined on February 19, 2024",1,Not the service you would expect at a Michelin star restaurant. They forgot one of the items we ordered. Had to move tables because servers kept bumping into husband. Definitely expected a different experience but the food was ok. The only dish that really stuck out to us was the foie gras dish.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 19, 2024",5,"This is the best tapas style restaurant we’ve ever eaten at. Excellent food, flavors, combinations!"
Tonypdb,"Dined on February 18, 2024",2,"Not 1 Michelin star for quality and service , not worth the reservation wait…"
jorgeolazagasti,"Dined on February 18, 2024",5,"Great place. The food was excellent, and the service was perfect."
KristinaK,"Dined on February 17, 2024",5,What a wonderful birthday dinner!  Everyone in our family loved it.  The food and wine were outstanding.  Mussels were the best I've ever had!
mussi9,"Dined on February 17, 2024",5,Always amazing. Our favorite restaurant in NY. See you soon.
PaulS,"Dined on February 16, 2024",4,Different food: very good fish in incredible sauces and combinations combine together for an excellent place.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 16, 2024",5,"La comida es exquisita. Las entradas, los principales, todo muy sabroso y excelente presentación. Muy buena carta de vinos"
JohnE,"Dined on February 16, 2024",5,"We left a package, but the host called to make sure I knew!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 16, 2024",5,The food tastes great! The decoration of the store is also very good! This is my first dinner in New York! I think it is a good start!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 12, 2024",3,"Sinceramente non so se New York regali le stelle Michelin. Ma questo non se la merita. Il menu è davvero molto interessante ma purtroppo la riuscita non è altrettanto. Piatti pieni di aglio tagliato grossolano, non da stella Michelin. Poca tecnica. Uova di salmone finte molecolari, durissime con un sapore di salmone affumicato. Davvero, per quanto ho speso mi sono sentito preso in giro. Sono uno Chef europeo che gira il mondo e i ristoranti stellati da 16 anni. Servizio buono però devo troppo stretto, nemmeno 10cm di distanza l’uno con l’altro, sentivo cosa dicevano i miei vicini. Tavoli piccolissimi, non riuscivo a mangiare, dovevo stare attento a non far cadere il calice.  Voglio premettere che vogliono essere le critiche mie, costruttive. Perché il locale ha tutte le capacità e lo posso consigliare assolutamente in quanto l’intenzione di fare un buon lavoro c’è, però non ancora all’altezza di esporre le stelle Michelin.  Buona trattoria, consigliata"
TedA,"Dined on February 12, 2024",4,"The food was simple.  Not super-Spanish, but well made and tasty.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The music is much too loud, especially for such a small place and how loudly people tend to speak.  It makes conversation difficult and it’s somewhat annoying.  Our table was ready 15 minutes past the time of the reservation, and they made us wait outside in the cold.  Not very elegant or welcoming."
RamonD,"Dined on February 10, 2024",5,"This is an amazing restaurant with delicious food,  great ambiance and polite staff."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 7, 2024",5,"We ate outside in their cabana on a cold February evening, and it was cozy. Food is so special, and the service is lovely."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 4, 2024",5,We had an incredible time at the Tempernillo wine class hosted at Bar Jamon. Great value for the quality and also very educational. I hope Casa Mono continues these wine classes as I would definitely recommend and go again!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2024",5,Great food and large wine selection. Great service. Tiny space.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 1, 2024",5,Fantastic food and service! Sommelier helped us choose delicious wine that paired with our meal
BrooklynMom,"Dined on February 1, 2024",4,"Love, love, love the razor clams! Great wine selection, too."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 28, 2024",4,"I have followed Casa Mono since it got its first Michelin star in 2009 - and finally got the opportunity to see if 14 consecutive one star awards is the real deal. As Michelin stars go, service is what seperate stars from no stars - food is always good even with non rated restaurants. The food was really good, wine even better (a great recommendation by the somm after some light guidance on our preferances). We were blown away by the goat and pork sausage dishes - a masterclass of sweet, meaty, fruity, acidity and texture. I’d like to focus on service - which sadly brings the review to a 4 instead of a 5. I will nit pick since any Michelin stars, in my experience, have been outstanding service. We had two servers, who were not communicating with each other - we were welcomed twice and given the course recommendation twice (we weren’t sure who our waiter was!). The restaurant was very tightly packed - not the best for a romantic date; it felt as though our fellow diners at the adjacent table were apart of the date too. Going back, I would sit down with a bottle of wine, and friend, and a couple selections from the whole animal section!"
NTKT,"Dined on January 27, 2024",5,"I was initially hesitant when I saw my reservation was for an outdoor table. However, the outdoor (covered) area was such a quaint place to have dinner with friends. There was no noise level and the lighting/ambience was perfect. I haven't visited Casa Mono in years so it was a nice return to an excellent spot."
Suzi,"Dined on January 27, 2024",3,"The food was good. the goat was probably our favorite dish..  The service, however, lacked the standard that the menu and ambience promised.  Also the air conditioning seemed to be set to “freeze” in our corner of the restaurant."
ChevyChaseDiner,"Dined on January 26, 2024",5,We came here many years ago and it still impresses. It was an special meal with excellent service. It still deserves its Michelin star.
MarinaK,"Dined on January 26, 2024",5,Great restaurant.  Excellent food and service. Definitely coming back. And bit cramped but its NYC
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 24, 2024",5,I have eaten all over the world and consider myself a foodie and Casa Mono is one of my favorite restaurants by far. Consistently outstanding. Service always the best. Can’t wait to go back. Get the pork belly!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 23, 2024",5,Great food and service. Pan con Tomate is a must try.
IsabelleO,"Dined on January 22, 2024",5,Belle expérience. Le fideoa était particulièrement délicieux ainsi que le arroz nero.   Nous y reviendrons
ThaiFiend,"Dined on January 21, 2024",5,"Mind boggling wonderful. We had had duck breast ; pork sobrasada with honey comb, Albania’s, scallops, eggs with sea urchin. Bone marrow, crème Catalan, bread pudding, chocolate ganache and a superb glass of Tinto.  The chef is a genius. One of the best meals of our lives."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 21, 2024",5,One of our best Spanish culinary and wine experience - for a one star Michellin - value for money too
Kelso,"Dined on January 20, 2024",4,"The bone marrow was something to come back for. Creamy, deliciousness. The pig ears were fried to perfection - very reminiscent of fresh chicharrones. The pork sausage was also phenomenal, going surprisingly well with the sweet flavor of the honeycomb. The scallops were cooked to perfection and paired well with the crunchy pistachios. The chocolate desert was heaven."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 14, 2024",5,"One of my favorite restaurants in the city. Unique tapas, incredible expansive Spanish wine list."
DrazenP,"Dined on January 11, 2024",4,"Great restaurant with absolutely amazing food and staff. Unfortunately, the hostess is often unwelcoming and tries to seat you at the least desirable table every time."
EllenS,"Dined on January 11, 2024",5,"I've been wanting to dine here for a while and was excited to finally get a reservation. It lived up to my expectations.  All of our dishes were delicious. I appreciated that our server timed and paired them so that we felt we had a proper meal vs just random tapas, didn't feel rushed or overwhelmed, and it felt paced. The somm was great and very helpful. I want to go back and try other dishes that I didn't have. Though would be happy to have repeats. Razor clams, goat confit, pan con tomate, uni egg, prawns, had the shishito peppers which were fine but other than needing something green, would likely skip that one. It was fine but nothing special."
Mrudbeck,"Dined on January 6, 2024",5,"Just amazing and creative food menu, which was matched by excellent wine and service."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 5, 2024",4,Food is delicious Wish they had more table/seats inside
TonianneM,"Dined on January 3, 2024",5,Very nice date night. It’s smaller than other restaurants in there but it gives a great comfy feel!! Food was amazing!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 2, 2024",5,"The space is nice and small, it’s warm and the lighting is perfect, I recommend it"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 1, 2024",5,"Excellent food, good service, reasonably priced. Very warm and welcoming environment although it’s small and could be crowded.  Overall it’s a great restaurant. Highly recommended."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 30, 2023",4,Could not see the wow affect about the food. ı would say there are better options
JoeM,"Dined on December 27, 2023",5,This place is an amazing little gem. The food was superb and the service was great. It’s going to become a must visit restaurant for me whenever I’m in NYC.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2023",3,"Been here many times and had fantastic meals. This one was disappointing- given a poor corner table when there was only one other table taken; was told by person at the front door we’d have only 1.15 hrs, no one turned up for a long time so slot if fuss about nothing. Generally felt rushed, not a special experience on Xmas eve - All bar one dish came at the same time which has never happened to us, overwhelming and the flavours of what we nearly always order weren’t what they usually are. Came away feeling quite bitter about spending $430+ for three of us on an average experience and a disappointing meal."
RayB,"Dined on December 21, 2023",5,"Absolutely fabulous.  Duck, scallops, razor clams off the charts."
MichaelM,"Dined on December 20, 2023",4,Big flavors in a small space.  They do a good job.
ChristianS,"Dined on December 20, 2023",3,"Most personel were smiling, but the one who recieved us at the door, seemed to have a tough day. Not many smiles. Food was okay, but far from perfect. Was reccommended the place from a friend and for now i can't recommend this place to others. Too much other good outthere. The crookets tasted like old fish.   Hope to see you back in shape in the futere. Stuff to work on"
AllisonK,"Dined on December 18, 2023",5,"This is an excellent restaurant!  It’s a great experience from the food to the atmosphere…so delicious and cozy.  Our service was amazing…helpful, kind and very capable.  Thoroughly enjoyed our evening!"
MarkS,"Dined on December 17, 2023",2,"Not a good experience. We love spanish food and were excited to try this Michelin starred restaurant for my wife's birthday. We had to wait 20 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. Service for drinks and order taking was quick, but it took over an hour for 6 small plates to reach our table. Some of the food was good, in particular the razor clams, but the rest was mediocre. Will not be back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 17, 2023",4,"Cozy ambience, nice service, excellent & creative food."
krimart,"Dined on December 15, 2023",5,"Fantastic food as always , warm service, great vibe!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 14, 2023",5,"An absolutely beautiful experience from start to finish. The Uni eggs, bone marrow, scallops, and burratta were some of the stand outs, but there was nothing short of delicious throughout. Service is impeccable, and the atmosphere is super vibey. Will be back soon."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 7, 2023",5,Amazing experience at Casa Mono. The wine was delicious & the wine consultant (didn’t catch his name) was really helpful in matching a wine we wanted within our price range & taste range. The food was delicious & the wait staff was very knowledgeable on how much to order for 2 people dining together. Great experience!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 6, 2023",5,"food was good but a tad on the salty side.  the service was okay, but i feel the prices were high for such small portions."
bettyc,"Dined on December 5, 2023",5,the noise level was perfect because we sat outside.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 4, 2023",4,"The hostess was not very nice. We came a little early, table was empty but we were told to leave. When we asked for a suggestion on a bar close by, we were told that he didn’t know, he only worked there.  When we returned, everything was perfect except that it took awhile before we got the menu, had to ask for it after 10-15 minutes. Perfect food, wine and service from there on."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 3, 2023",5,Me encanta Casa Mono. Me siento como que estoy en España
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 3, 2023",5,"We have been coming to Casa Mono for almost 20 years, it is a requirement every time we visit NYC.  The restaurant just gets better and better, staying fresh and current while keeping the tradition of tapas.  The staff is everything a diner could hope for-courteous, knowledgeable, and obviously passionate about the restaurant and the food.  Fantastic!!!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 1, 2023",5,One of our all time favorite places for lunch or celebrations.

AmyD,"Dined on November 28, 2023",5,"excellent creative dishes with attentive and personal service....wait staff know the dishes well, which is very helpful with ""new"" ingredients for some diners. Portions are fine for two people to share each tapas dish.  Overall, really quite expensive, wine as well---but I'd go back because I loved the food!!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 28, 2023",5,"Fantastic as usual! Great 20 years, let’s go for another 20!"

TanyaA,"Dined on November 18, 2023",3,"Sea food was fresh, service was good, Tapas were excellent but overpriced & outdoor sitting was fine. Wine list was extensive but only beer & wine is served so forget about having an Old Fashion! 🥃"

KarenZ,"Dined on November 12, 2023",5,Coming back for the second time and the experience was equally amazing!
DebS,"Dined on November 12, 2023",2,"It was fine. Tbh I went in with higher expectations considering the Michelin star. Outdoor covered seating was originally super loud though it got quieter as new people came in.  Service was fine. Again, it was fine… nothing stood out as GREAT"
DesirreH,"Dined on November 11, 2023",5,"Took my husband here for his birthday last night and had the most amazing time. We started at their sister bar next door with drinks and then had dinner here. The food was amazing, the service was great and overall we would definitely come again."
KakiToo,"Dined on November 11, 2023",1,"The food was absolutely delicious. The staff was horrible—rude and unprofessional from start to finish. We arrived early and were told to go next door to a wine bar and wait. There were no seats there.  I was wearing a knee brace and walking with a cane and could not stand, so we sat at the Casa Mono’s bar (there were 3 seats there) to wait for our table. The maitre d’ told us he needed the seats for a reservation and we should stand outside in the cold. They didn’t offer us a table to wait at in their heated outdoor space. We continued to sit at the bar and ordered a $90 bottle of wine. We were seated soon after. Service was deliberately slow. We had to wait 20 minutes for the sommelier to bring it to the table after he had shown it to us. We ordered three appetizers, which were wonderful. Our waiter ignored us for 20 minutes before coming to take our dinner order. He was patronizingly dismissive of our questions about the menu and did not answer them. My husband got very angry, lost his temper, and insulted him. After he took our entree order, a girl came to tell us that we would not be served any more food or wine because my husband had insulted the waiter and she left the check. We were told to leave immediately after without finishing our dinner. No one came in after us to take the 3 seats at the bar that the maitre d’ insisted were reserved for diners. I have never been treated so badly by wait staff. (Was it ageism? I don’t know. We were 3 well-dressed older people who know our way around good restaurants in NYC and had looked forward to eating at Casa Mono.) Needless to say, we’ll never go back."
Foodfan,"Dined on November 9, 2023",3,"For the price points, this restaurant is overrated."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 8, 2023",3,"My second time at Casa Mono this year and for some reason wasn’t even close to as good. The food felt very average, and I ordered nearly all the same dishes I did in July. Quite disappointed."
Atilla,"Dined on November 7, 2023",4,"My dining partner loves the food here and is willing to put up with the severely cramped dining space. I am less enthusiastic about having to sit at a small table in a tight, uncomfortable position with service people bumping into me or my chair especially if the people sitting inches from you are loud.  The food is very good, but at this price level it is not a great dining experience."
Wizzz,"Dined on November 7, 2023",5,Amazing food and a lot of combinations of wine to go with the delicious cuisines
Raymond,"Dined on November 6, 2023",5,pulpo was amazing! would recommend it to all if you are an octopus fan
MirnaS,"Dined on November 6, 2023",5,GREAT AS ALWAYS!!! I love the food the ambiance the service

BTC9,"Dined on November 4, 2023",4,"Excellent and friendly service.   Food was delicious,  but some very small portions  for the price point."
MichaelS,"Dined on November 2, 2023",5,"Excellent food, and a truly spectacular wine list, including the best sherry (Jerez) selection I have seen in a restaurant in the States.   Space is fairly small and crowded, but the service is excellent, and the ambiance is charming with great character."

RachelM,"Dined on October 22, 2023",5,"Always a good time and always the freshest, most creative, most delicious dishes!  Stellar wine list, friendly staff.  Grab a seat at the chef's bar for an elevated dining experience!"
NatashaC,"Dined on October 20, 2023",3,"Ambiance was nice but sadly we got the worst seat in the house, scrunched between two other tables. Food was just alright, honestly the dish I liked most were the patatas bravas. Nothing truly wowed me. Maybe we didn’t order correctly but we asked our waiter to guide us to the best dishes. I would come back but probably ask for bar seating or one of the more private tables."
NewYorker1,"Dined on October 20, 2023",2,Nice atmosphere but the food is bad and very overprice for what it is. Would not recommend.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 19, 2023",3,"I love this place. Food is great. The only thing , our table was not ready and we had to wait more then 30min outside and they didn’t offer us anything complimentary while waiting They have 15min police to keep the bookings, but they feel very comfortable to make us wait 30min outside. Not very professional"

JHsu,"Dined on October 15, 2023",5,The razor clams were too good to be true. The desert with the vanilla custard (creme brûlée) and deep fried bay leaves was very special and indulgent
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 11, 2023",5,Amazing experience as always!!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 8, 2023",2,Im completely disappointed with this place. I went with high expectations but food was average in terms on flavor… overpriced for the quality of the food.
BandF,"Dined on October 7, 2023",4,"It was a last minute booking with little research made except a quick scroll through the photos. I have to say it was a great choice. We were looked after by a lovely waiter Fabio who took us through all the menu in detail. The food was sized as tapas which was delicious, beautifully presented and full of flavour. Although the restaurant is quite small it isn’t loud and never felt cramped. We will definitely return."
Oman,"Dined on October 7, 2023",5,"If you’re seeking authentic Spanish cuisine, then Casa Mono is the place for you. The sweetbread with fennel al mono and marcona almond vinaigrette is delicious, and the shirt steak romesco and onion is absolutely fantastic and  my final recommendation fideos with chorizo, clams, and garlic sherry aioli are to die for. This is only a sample of the many delightful dishes Casa Mono has to offer to its guest."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 5, 2023",5,Amazing. I see why the place has kept a Michelin star for so long.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 2, 2023",1,"Casa Mono’s food was absolutely fantastic- especially the razor clams, and pasta with clams and chorizo. We were really disappointed by the service. The staff were rude, seated us in a corner behind a wall, and forgot us multiple times. After taking our order, we never saw our server again. We waited a half hour after our last dish for our check."
Opentable85,"Dined on October 1, 2023",5,Everything was delicious and the service was attentive
PercyZ,"Dined on October 1, 2023",4,The service has room for improvement and food was a bit salty for my liking
CHRV,"Dined on October 1, 2023",5,"Great food, but the restaurant needs more space. Overall, a pleasant dinner."
DonaC,"Dined on September 26, 2023",5,"Loved Casa Mono. Food, service, and vibe were perfect."
FionaL,"Dined on September 25, 2023",5,Cannot praise Casa Mono enough! An absolute find. We will be back!
Liss,"Dined on September 25, 2023",5,The food was excellent! The creations by the chefs we're outstanding and presented very well. I would highly recommend Casa Mono for a nice dinner with a date or some friends. Tapas style with quite the variation.
jeffreyN,"Dined on September 25, 2023",3,"As I remembered from past visits the food was good, but, unlike previous visits, the service was poor at best.  It was 4pm on a rainy Sunday, and the restaurant was not full.  It’s a small one room restaurant and it should be easy to stay on top of things, but the waiters were more interested in chatting with each other.  I had to ask multiple times to get a second glass of wine, and there was never an inquiry if we were enjoying our experience or wanted anything else.  The overall feeling of indifference was appalling. I won’t return."
PizzaMan,"Dined on September 24, 2023",1,"As soon as I walked into the restaurant, the hostess told me that I needed to be out of the restaurant after 90 minutes. Great way to start off my anniversary dinner with my wife."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 19, 2023",5,"Food was absolutely on top. Great service, nobody put us in rush. Will go back for sure"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 19, 2023",1,The food was fine. The service was somewhat average compared to other michelin restaurants.
Stan,"Dined on September 16, 2023",5,I like that the portions are just right. The food and service was excellent. I'll be back.
RCA2,"Dined on September 13, 2023",3,"Good but some food cold or not so good   We over ordered because they want you to order all your food upfront , a ploy that works I believe   Staff busy but attentive"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 10, 2023",5,"Amazing food, service was great. It was a bit too loud. Hard to have a conversation"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 10, 2023",5,They added an extra seat for us out in the box on  Irving. The air conditioning was nice and the sommelier Hector was great!  We will be back again to Bar Jamon!!!
VitoriaB,"Dined on September 7, 2023",5,"Amazing plates! Everything we ate was terrific. The plates are perfect to share but are small, In 3 people you should order at least 6 options if you want to feel satiated it. We ordered a bottle of Cava which was great too."
Coco,"Dined on September 7, 2023",5,"The food is amazing! We sat in the sidewalk booth, which is not beautiful but quiet. It’s quite expensive but worth it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2023",3,"Service was perfect. All the staff very friendly and helpful. The food was not great. The bathroom was disgusting, needing cleaning urgently."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2023",1,"If I am being completely honest, this was one of the worst dining experiences at this price point I’ve ever had. It took 20 minutes for water to be refilled. The table wobbled, and after asking for a new table we were told it was the ground, not the table… okay? We shared some plates and wanted to order more. We were told that they transitioned to the dinner menu. Great! Let’s order from the dinner menu. Oh, we can’t? Why not? I see others eating off the dinner menu right now. “Because you already ordered stuff off the lunch menu”. I was appalled"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2023",5,Each plate was unique and delicious. The wine suggestion was spot on.  Service was on point without being intrusive. Go and enjoy a couple hours of happiness!
JaneC,"Dined on September 2, 2023",5,This restaurant never disappoints!!  Every bite is delicious!!  Service is fantastic!!!
Dineoutfreak,"Dined on September 1, 2023",5,"Delicious creative food.  Good service.  Small portions, pricy"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 1, 2023",5,"It’s a really good spanish influence restaurant, I recommend to  eat 6 different plates to share !!!"
Peter,"Dined on September 1, 2023",5,"it is not a big portions, therefore you can orders a bit more  scallops creamy eggs, Razor clams and lamb lengua are worth to try"
AnnaD,"Dined on August 31, 2023",5,"Matt was an excellent server, everyone was so lovely. Juan Pablo made an excellent wine choice for us, and we can't wait to return."
BigMo,"Dined on August 27, 2023",5,First class Spanish tapa’s experience in Gramercy Park.  We left NYC 15 years ago and Casa Mono remains at the top of list of restaurants to visit.
JaneC,"Dined on August 27, 2023",5,"Our dinner was absolutely delicious!!  Every bite, as always!  Staff was friendly and very Professional. The wine that was recommended for our dinner was spot on! A wonderful experience and we’ll be back!!"
SorinI,"Dined on August 26, 2023",3,"Food is a basic reinterpretation of spanish cuisine, quantity minimized to tapas size dish, with an outrageous 50 dollars 25g jamon portion……well, you can get the proper one, in Spain, for 12 dollars, 5 times the size :( . Tables are also suffering from downsizing, proper for kindergarten…."
JameyL,"Dined on August 26, 2023",5,Wonderful tasting dishes and nice intro to Tempranillo wines.
SebastianL,"Dined on August 25, 2023",5,Incredible authentic food from Spain. Great for a dinner with foodie friends from UK.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 24, 2023",5,It’s impeccable- from the service to ambiance to the incredible and unique food and drink. our favorite spot
RebekahK,"Dined on August 23, 2023",5,"Hidden away on Irving Place, Casa Mono is an absolute gem that effortlessly blends exquisite wines, delectable pork sobrasada, and an enchanting atmosphere to create an unparalleled dining experience. From the moment you step in, you're enveloped in an ambiance that combines elegance with comfort, making it the perfect destination for meeting friends."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 22, 2023",4,It was OK. Tapas could be better. We had to wait a lot to be seated but we came a lot early. They had open tables but maybe there are other valid reason why they did not seat us.
AndreaD,"Dined on August 22, 2023",5,Great food and service. Just wine and beer. Good selection of Spanish wines
ZongleW,"Dined on August 22, 2023",5,"Shrimps and razor clams were all high quality and well cooked, taste good! The stewed oxtail in pepper looked like a Chinese dishes called 酿尖椒 xD"
MaxD,"Dined on August 20, 2023",4,"Food was good, not traditional but still quite good. Service was excellent"
LaFleur,"Dined on August 20, 2023",5,Our favorite restaurant on the planet. Friendly staff. Fun atmosphere. Wide variety of great dishes. Superb wine list. Chefs counter + razor clams = culinary ecstasy!

Woofus,"Dined on August 11, 2023",5,"Interesting menu, excellent food, attentive service. Very small but charming space with sun streaming in at lunch."
MLogan,"Dined on August 9, 2023",3,"The food was good, the service and hospitality was wildly lackluster. This is the only Michelin restaurant experience that I have ever had that wasn’t special. It felt like any other normal restaurant. We arrived a bit early, our table wasn’t ready. No problem at all, but when our reservation time came around, our table still wasn’t ready. We went to bar jamon next door and after about 20 more minutes our table was ready. Our server never mentioned his name. We saw him once at the beginning of the meal, briefly for a second glass of wine and for the bill. Of the 9 plates we ordered, he checked on us once. The food runner / server assistant however, was great. At the end of the meal our server came to the table and asked “do you want any dessert?”  No menu presented, no after dinner drinks offered, the staff was a bit rowdy with their shift drinks while we were still finishing our last courses. It was very apparent that we were the last table and they were ready for us to leave. We didn’t feel as if we had overstayed our welcome, our dining experience had been less than an hour and a half and every location of posted hours said they were open until midnight and it was hardly 11pm. My goal is not to bash the restaurant at all; I guess from previous Michelin dining experiences, and a nearly $400 price tag I thought it would be a bit more special."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 8, 2023",5,Honestly my happiness place. Only get there very occasionally now but the food is superb and the staff is very  attentive to everything
DiegoR,"Dined on August 6, 2023",5,Excellent service and Great Great Food!!! We will be back!!!
mussi9,"Dined on August 5, 2023",5,"Always amazing food, hospitality & ambience. We’ll be back soon!"
NaguiS,"Dined on August 2, 2023",4,a bit pricy but quality of the food is excellent.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 1, 2023",5,"The food was amazing, alittle pricey but totally worth the trip"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 29, 2023",5,Highlights were the confit goat and the burrata!
TurhanS,"Dined on July 27, 2023",5,Very good tapas in a cosy setting located in a charming area of the city.  A New York gem!
Andrew,"Dined on July 27, 2023",3,"Been eating here almost 20 years.  Still good, but I feel they've lost a step recently."
Tony2E,"Dined on July 24, 2023",5,Hands down one of the best restaurants in NYC. Simple as that.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 22, 2023",1,Terrible service. Have been multiple times. Very unexpected. Very sad
AmiM,"Dined on July 21, 2023",5,Food was out of the world and services were fantastic.  We’ll definitely come back.
kims,"Dined on July 19, 2023",4,Very good tapas at very high prices. Definitely a splurge restaurant. Nice atmosphere.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 17, 2023",5,Everything about Casa Mono exceeds expectations. A truly special experience.
RobinM,"Dined on July 15, 2023",5,Deserves a starry night! Dreamy meal and presentation. Star server! Celebration to savor evermore.
MP99,"Dined on July 13, 2023",3,Very inconsistent experience for us….some dishes are a laughable value (3 small scallops for $30!?) while others were solid (skirt steak).  Service was ok but not much attention 2nd half of meal and needed to request water twice.  Wine list seems purposely confusing for a casual spot…but you can guess why.
Lemon,"Dined on July 12, 2023",4,great service and ambience. We really loved the seafood dishes
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 11, 2023",5,You gotta eat here. Everything is seriously delicious (I didn’t try some of the more adventurous fare). Great atmosphere and fun. First time I ate there I sort of wandered in. I had never heard of razor clams before and now my life’s complete. Went back with my daughter and her boyfriend last night and everything was as amazing as the first time.
Atilla,"Dined on July 11, 2023",4,"Pros:  as always:  great food with great ingredients and well presented, well presented.  Also, good service  Cons:  the noise level, the extremely cramped seating and the overload of salt"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 11, 2023",1,"The music in this place is just too loud. This has long been one of my favorite places in NYC, but the loud music is just ruining it."
2di4,"Dined on July 10, 2023",5,"But I’m prejudiced—my favourite restaurant in New York.  Tapas like you’ve never had before, creamy eggs with sea urchin or strips of fried pig’s ears with melon.  Every one a winner.  Excellent all-Spanish wine list by the bottle or 250 ml.  Richly deserves its Michelin star, and not exorbitantly expensive like so many NY starred restaurants.  Can get quite buzzy in the evening—go for lunch if you can."
CarlaL,"Dined on July 9, 2023",4,Great food. Excellent and extensive ￼Spanish wine list.
Delicious,"Dined on July 9, 2023",5,It was wonderful to see that Casa Mono has remained consistently delicious!
AnnaD,"Dined on July 8, 2023",5,Sublime Spanish tapas and service. I will recommend to go when in NY
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 6, 2023",5,Todo excelente.  10 puntos.  Volvería a ir.  Recomendable
EugeneF,"Dined on July 5, 2023",4,We have dined here many time and it is always a treat. A bit overpriced as they are likely justifying it on the Michelin Star which is well deserved. We didn’t love dining in the outside shed which was nicely appointed and climate controlled as part of the experience is the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen and intimate setting. We made the best of it and enjoyed the food as usual.
Foodie,"Dined on July 3, 2023",5,Best meal I’ve ever had. Would go back in a heartbeat.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 2, 2023",3,"A couple of your staff were not friendly!!! Food were amazing, this was not our first time dining here but this time, totally ruined the one meal experience I look forward to when I’m in New York."
Zoee,"Dined on July 1, 2023",3,Food was really disappointing. Will not be coming back unfortunately
EricS,"Dined on June 28, 2023",5,Elite experience. I cant imagine a restaurant being as delicious.
FavoritePlace,"Dined on June 27, 2023",5,"Tight Tight Tight!!!!! An old school NY restaurant with NO room between tables! Can be fun if you are in the mood for that, but annoying if you arrive expecting something different. Food is delicious and interesting. Wine choices are nice."
AndreaP,"Dined on June 24, 2023",5,Food was fabulous! Soooo delicious!  Wine was fantastic!  Matt our server was great and very helpful!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 24, 2023",5,We sat outside and enjoyed a soft breeze and a little more space than some of the tables inside. Try to get a table outside of the weather is nice. The food was outstanding. 3 of us share 9 or 10 dishes - every dish was very beautifully plated and equally delicious. Our server was excellent with making suggestions and helped guide us through a very enjoyable meal. Would definitely recommend!
Experienceddiner,"Dined on June 23, 2023",5,"Danielle is the best! Great food, better service. Favorite spot in the city!"
JSD7,"Dined on June 21, 2023",5,"Don't miss out on the lamb belly, scallops, bone marrow and ensalada Mono, but you really can't go wrong with their menu!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 21, 2023",5,The food was off the chart. Best culinary experience of my life.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 17, 2023",5,"Everything we ordered here was delicious. Highly recommend the skirt steak, duck breast, albondigas and patatas bravas.  Also, the sommelier was very helpful in finding a reasonably priced bottle of wine from a huge and mostly quite pricey wine list."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 15, 2023",1,Our experience was unfortunatelly unpleasant. we were rushed by a waiter from the second we sat at our table. It was very clear we had 90 min to enjoy our dinner and there was no need to rush is ordering food and asking if we are still working on our food (8 - literally eight times) while we were eating and while we still had 30 min left from the generous 90 min we had for our meal. i won’t be back. dinner is not just about food
Gallo,"Dined on June 14, 2023",5,"Good food, good fun. Very pleasant. Looking forward to going back."
Khutulun,"Dined on June 13, 2023",2,"Came here for my birthday and regretted it. The food was simply not up to par. The sweetbread was greasy and not at all seasoned. My sister and I took two bites and couldn’t finish the rest. The foie gras sauce overpowered everything in that dish. While I did enjoy some of the other dishes like the razor clams and fluke crudo, the other dishes really dampened the experience as did the service. It was busy (and loud) so the service was understandably not great. I was not asked how the food was or why the majority of the sweetbread dish was unfinished. I would not come here again and was sorry to have spent my birthday here."
SarahT,"Dined on June 11, 2023",5,"Always a real treat to come here. The service, food, and wine are impeccable. Looking forward to my next visit."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 11, 2023",4,"Absolutely love casa mono, go often with my boyfriend. When my mom came in town to visit I thought there would be no better place to take her then here! I had an 8:45 reservation showed up on time and didn’t get seated until 9:10. So disappointing. They got my name associated with my reservation wrong several times after repeatedly telling them my correct name.super upsetting"

JuanPi,"Dined on June 10, 2023",2,"Food was bad. Did the owners change recently? It used to be one of my favorites places in NYC, but after yesterday’s experience I will never come back"
Beth,"Dined on June 9, 2023",5,This was an amazing culinary experience from beginning to end. Our waiter was fantastic. The food was exquisite and interesting. The wine was great. The atmosphere was relaxed and not pretentious at all. We would return in a heartbeat and would recommend it to everyone.

Davidg,"Dined on June 8, 2023",4,"we have been coming since 2011  whenever we hit NYC, food is consistently high standard casual but sophisticated ambience, great wine and sherry list and always high quality service and insights, can't imagine not including this at least once per visit forever"

AlexB,"Dined on June 8, 2023",5,The food was terrific and we had a great bottle of Vatan wine.
Maryk,"Dined on June 6, 2023",5,Brilliant in every way! A glorious array of delightful and delicious small plates!
FoodLover,"Dined on June 5, 2023",4,"Very creative and delicious food. However, small disappointment regarding desserts during our visit: we made our order of 2 desserts and only then 5 min later the waiter returned just to tell us that restaurant is pout of one of our desserts that we ordered. This is disappointing for guest to get the hopes which had been crushed later. From the Micheline star restaurant there is an expectation to let the guest know which things are out of order before someone makes an order and set up the expectations. But overall very pleasant experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 3, 2023",5,"Razor clams, Jamon, scallops, and skirt steak delicious"

Glitterbug,"Dined on May 25, 2023",4,"Lovely dinner, one of the few restaurants in NYC that I find worth returning to repeatedly. But please don’t serve hot tea with the teabag already sitting in the water in the cup:  place the new teabag to the side, and let the diner decide how long to steep the tea."
diner4452,"Dined on May 24, 2023",5,Looking forward to returning. One of doesn’t eat pork and the other vegetarian and still so so great.

Jordaneatz,"Dined on May 17, 2023",5,"First time dining here…delicious and amazing food. Great ambiance. Delightful service.

CrunchLunchFan,"Dined on May 12, 2023",5,"We ate in the outdoor shack, so the ambiance and noise were a factor of that. Food and wine, as always, wonderful. Especially the sweetbreads."
erickpereda,"Dined on May 10, 2023",2,"The food is interesting but never amazing. Very noisy and service was average. Overall it is a descent place to enjoy some tapas and a descent Spanish wine list with friends. It is not a place to go on a date, to discuss business nor to have an amazing dinner experience."
Onyx,"Dined on May 7, 2023",5,Amazing! Thank you for a wonderful birthday celebration!
OmarJ,"Dined on May 5, 2023",2,"Honestly I don't understand why they have a michelin star. The food was unremarkable at best, there are plenty of better options in NYC. The ambience is also nothing special. Nothing stood out."
DFNY,"Dined on May 2, 2023",5,Tiny gem with brilliant food and wine.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 29, 2023",5,Food was really delicious especially the quality of the ingredients and how well the sauce blended in with each dish. It’s a must try if you are in NYC
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 29, 2023",5,"Food was delicious and loved sitting at the chef’s bar, but it felt like dishes were brought out slowly. There was a lot of time in between dishes."
TPhil,"Dined on April 29, 2023",5,Thanks to the team at Casa Mono - special shout out to our server and the sommelier!
JulieS,"Dined on April 27, 2023",4,"Food was great. Service was great. Restaurant space itself doesn't feel as elevated as the rest of the experience, but still totally recommend going!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 27, 2023",3,Always look forward to visiting Casa Mono however I was surprised to know they didn’t really cared about out 10th year Anniversary.  I made sure to tell them our first meal together was at Casa Mono and we made sure we came back to celebrate our 10th year there.  Although we also visited many times during those 10 years. We came all the way from California and was so disappointed with the lack of acknowledgment.
StevenF,"Dined on April 26, 2023",5,"Although the indoor space is intimate and fairly noisy, the outdoor but fully enclosed dining was elegant and quiet, even with two other tables in our space.  Our waiter was extraordinarily helpful in explaining the complicated dishes on the creative menu."

MaineEater,"Dined on April 20, 2023",5,"Every bite at Casa Mono was swoon-worthy! From the addictive crispy pig ears to the succulent shrimp to the paella croqueta...insanely delicious. The goat confit stole the show--no one should miss this gem. Incredible wine list and super knowledgeable staff. When our wine choice was delayed by needing to be chilled, our glasses were kept full of the house bubbly until it arrived. Can't wait to go back!"
Philip,"Dined on April 18, 2023",5,"Food was amazing, wine list really great, atmosphere as well."
CruiseExec,"Dined on April 17, 2023",5,Always a fantastic experience at this classic Tapas restaurant. Enjoyed sitting at the chef’s counter watching them prepare their amazing dishes.
MrsJ,"Dined on April 15, 2023",5,Consistently great food and service.  Solid place.
StaceyW,"Dined on April 12, 2023",4,"Was a little disappointed that we were seated in the outdoor vestibule without the option to sit inside after waiting 20 minutes for our table. Once seated the service was fantastic. Our server and gave great recommendations and the busser Juan (I think that’s his name) was absolutely fantastic. He was incredibly attentive, courteous and detailed - as he was giving me a new fork he noticed it was dirty and immediately got a new one before I even realized."
Effdotemm,"Dined on April 12, 2023",5,"Quality of food was excellent. Wished that our waiter was a little bit more attentive and offer up suggestions, given that it was our first time at the place and it was a birthday dinner.   Otherwise, 4/5 overall."
Katie,"Dined on April 10, 2023",2,"Worst food we had at a Michelin starred restaurant and we dined at a lot of Michelin starred places. We had the burrata, scallops, skirt steak and mushrooms. All of them were below average, flavors too strong or weird spice combinations. Best part of the dinner was wine. Skip this place if you are looking for good food."
CelluloidGypsy,"Dined on April 9, 2023",3,"The food was good, but not outstanding. The panne con tomate was soggy and oily rather than garlicky. The salad was fantastic but the other plates were good, but nothing I’d be rushing back for."
PAFoodie,"Dined on April 7, 2023",5,"Dinner with the family excellent service stellar food! If you’re looking for more quiet dining outside is the way to go. Standouts-Razor Clams, Duck Breast, Sausage with honeycomb and quince, Foie gras, Black Rice. Sherry on the recommendation of the sommelier was great."
IlseV,"Dined on April 5, 2023",2,Very small en noisy restaurant. We needed to sit in a little corner very small. The food was very good but the portions were small en expensive. Every 5 minutes someone else came asking if we wanted to order more. On the reservation form i mentioned that it was my birthday that evening but they didn’t asked anything and we had the feeling they wanted us quickly to leave. We expected to spend the evening there but the food came so quickly that we had to leave soon
AlisonP,"Dined on April 4, 2023",5,"great good, lovely outdoor dining, good wine and amazing vibe."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 3, 2023",1,"The server spilled the sause onto my partner’s clothes, which ruined the day. The food is okay."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 2, 2023",5,"The omakasi experience was exceptional. The chefs were very generous, great recommendations from the Bar Tender Caesar as well. The host Antonio was very kind as well. Overal one of the best meals and experiences I have ever had!! Highly Recommended!!"
CoryM,"Dined on April 2, 2023",5,Every bite from start to finish was incredible. After a very disappointing dinner at a french bistro the prior night this was exactly what we needed. Very charming spot with amazijg food.
LeslieB,"Dined on April 2, 2023",5,The food was outstanding as was the service and wine selections.
J20food,"Dined on April 1, 2023",5,"Everything was delicious! Mono salad, razor clams, scallops and skirt steak were the highlights.  The staff was amazing!! Love this place"
SamC,"Dined on March 29, 2023",5,It was pretty good overall. The food was amazing and desert was also very good! I would recommend this restaurants for those who are looking for something different.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 29, 2023",5,Wonderful. Every dish was flavorful beyond Expectations.
ABNYC,"Dined on March 27, 2023",4,"the food is very good but knowing how much things cost in Spain, it is very pricey. Be prepared to shell out. Remember, this is NYC not Spain."
MakP,"Dined on March 26, 2023",4,"You can go to Casa Mono an expect to have a lovely, delicious dinner. However, given its Michelin star I went into my experience with higher expectations than usual and was somewhat disappointed. The food was excellent, better than the average New York restaurant. However, some elements were lacking: we sat in the outdoor covered seating (which I highly recommend) but inside it is uncomfortably crowded and very loud, our server was very knowledgeable but not very attentive and we didn't see him much after the initial introduction, the bathroom was a bit dirty with paper towels on the floor, and they forgot one of the dishes we ordered and we had to remind them. These are not elements that normally detract from my experience, but like I said, I expected a bit more from a Michelin starred restaurant."
DenisG,"Dined on March 25, 2023",5,"Great food and service; our plane was late by over an hour and they were able to sit us despite de delay, always being extremely pleasant and nice on the phone."
marcus,"Dined on March 25, 2023",4,"We sat outside, which was less crowded and noisy than inside.  The food is unchanged and very good, but seemed to lack some sparkle.  Wine list of interesting Spanish wines was somewhat better priced than most NYC restaurants at this time."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 25, 2023",4,Food and wine were great. Sat outside and was still very comfortable. Staff could have been more friendly.
Lucullus,"Dined on March 24, 2023",4,"The food, as always, was outstanding. Compliments to the chef(s), for their dishes were original, authentic and perfectly prepared. The variety and quality of the ingredients were a huge success for our table of four. This is one of the best restaurants in Manhattan as far as food is concerned. However, once again, I found the noise level to be much too high. The pounding sound issuing from the several loudspeakers  in that tiny space made it difficult to sustain a conversation without having to shout to each other across the table. Excellent food needs the right environment to be fully appreciated, and loud music does not contribute to such an environment."
christianb,"Dined on March 22, 2023",5,"One of my go-to restaurants. Always consistent, never disappointed and always a wonderful experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 22, 2023",5,The best Spanish wine list outside of Spain. Food is undeniably amazing. Go now.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 16, 2023",5,Outstanding service and an exceptional sommelier who provided perfect pairing advice for the 15 small plate courses our party ordered.  Perfect kitchen execution in an intimate and warm setting.  Totally deserving of its Michelin star.  Looking forward to returning soon!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 15, 2023",5,"Delicious. The only way to describe the food at Casa Mono. We had 5 dishes plus desert with wine pairing between two of us. It was perfect. The sommelier chose delicious wines for us that went well with our food. We started with The Casa Mono Salad, which is kind of otherworldly, followed by Lamb Belly (amazing) Pulpo and their signature Bone Marrow dish, and close with the Bread Pudding… incredible. The ambience was relaxed and the service was attentive. Certainly coming back!"
Mirabelle,"Dined on March 13, 2023",5,I've been to this restaurant before but it's been about 4 years. It's always been good but now it's outstanding. Interesting combinations of textures and flavors done so well.

nnnn,"Dined on March 9, 2023",3,This is a small and rather intimate restaurant. It should not be necessary with loud music. We were onyl two people in our party and had difficulties hearing each other.
hwang,"Dined on March 8, 2023",4,"Our reservation was 6:45pm, but we had to wait for another 15 minutes to be seated. Very tight seating so you are elbow to elbow to your neighboring tables…a little uncomfortable. The food and service are excellent."

Zedline,"Dined on February 24, 2023",2,The service was not welcoming we felt like nobody care. A bit pushy too. I’m from Canada and Every time I come to NYC I eat at Casa Mono But t this time is the last one. Food was ok and not a big choice of wine by the glass
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 22, 2023",5,Just perfect. Food end wines. Excellent value.
AgofFields,"Dined on February 21, 2023",4,Went for lunch and had a GREAT experience.  Noise level was low and food was super.
RachelW,"Dined on February 19, 2023",5,At Casa Mono everything is delicious. Choosing only 4-6 dishes to share is such a difficult decision and you can’t go wrong. We will definitely be back!
Barbaresco,"Dined on February 17, 2023",3,"Arrived early and asked the host to seat us at a corner 2-top instead of the 2-top in the middle of the room, which was right under the speakers and very loud. (I’m hard of hearing, and informed her of this.) She declined with an explanation that made no sense and then when (gently)pressed, replied brusquely, “I can’t do it.” Fifteen minutes later, she sat another couple there, who were still there when we left the restaurant. Given that this was a reasonable request at a rather expensive restaurant, and no explanation was given, this behavior was off putting and unacceptable."
108NYC,"Dined on February 16, 2023",5,Lunch is the time to go for quieter noice levels. And you can't beat the opportunity to try multiple delicious dishes. Love their perfectly cooked scallops w delicious sauce one of the best things I have ever tasted ever.

theneighborhoodMel,"Dined on February 5, 2023",5,"Amazing service, the staff seemed seamless ready for the guests that were seated and waiting for their tables. I felt super comfortable seated at the chefs table. We had a nice convo with chef Diego who was super hospitable and knowledgeable about their creations. He even gave us a special treat complimentary for dessert. Would Love to Make this place regular for an imitate date night with my partner.   5 stars times 100. 100 percent would recommend to anyone who is interested in trying a nice cozy Spanish eatery off of Irving st, serving dishes that would make you feel at home yet out for dinner."

ROBF,"Dined on January 29, 2023",3,The food was exceptional but we were seated at the bar next to the back door which was constantly being open and closed all night where cold drafts were slapping us in the midst of our meal.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 29, 2023",5,"Awesome food, awesome ambiance. Can’t wait to go again."
HectorC,"Dined on January 28, 2023",5,"Second time back, if I have to say one word it would be consistent. Both in food quality and service. No fluck they have a gazzilion Michelin Stars.  Raquel was a wonderful host and Chef Jonathan went out of his way. Considering he's the Chef of a Michelin Star restaurant, you have to appreciate his willingness to stop by and say hello to a patron that requested to say thank you in person. Awesome!  We'll be back everytime we're in NYC."
AnneF,"Dined on January 28, 2023",5,Best tapas food I’ve ever had! Every choice better than the next. Definitely recommend!
Spinsrod,"Dined on January 28, 2023",3,"The dishes were excellent really delicious as usual. The sommelier knowledgeable, amiable and cordial. The service/waiter not so much- 15-20 minutes after we sat at our  table we were told that they needed the table by 7:30. We finished our dinner around 7:15. Around 7:40 after ignoring us walking by us about 5 times and not offering a dessert menu the waiter came back with the bill and walked away without a word about dessert. When he came back for the bill 15min later I asked for the dessert menu and he emphatically said to us “I told you we needed the table by 7:30 it is 7:41 now (it wasn’t it was later) and I can’t offer you dessert only a chocolate mousse - we need the table now” . The people at the table next to us all looked at us — heard what was going on. I declined the dessert they offered, but they brought it anyways. We put our cards and the waiter did not pick up the bill  someone else did. In all the time they took to bring the bill - ask us to leave - pick up the bill - they could’ve offer the dessert menu and even perhaps prepares/ serve the dessert that I wanted. But I guess they just wanted us out of there because they did not even offer to sit us somewhere else. One of the people sitting next to us came up to me while waiting on the line for the bathroom and told me that they had seen how rude they were and how the restaurant had essentially kicked us out for no apparent reason. I had been to Casa Mono many times, brought many friends to dine there, always a great experience until this past Friday."
SabrinaM,"Dined on January 27, 2023",5,Amazing food and vibes!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 22, 2023",4,waiter was rude and told us 2-3 plates per person which was way too much and we ended up missing a reservation because it took so long
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 21, 2023",5,Great staff! We were full and they let us cancel the dishes that weren’t out yet- great!
JohnF,"Dined on January 21, 2023",5,Everything was above & beyond expectations! From the moment you walk in the attention to detail is exquisite! The entire experience is like a beautiful work of art…Amazing!!
MEWD,"Dined on January 20, 2023",5,Fernando was an exquisite guide for our meal and his wine recommendations for 3 different tastes were absolutely perfect.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 7, 2023",5,This place deserves a Michelin star. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 7, 2023",5,Excellent!
JohnT,"Dined on January 6, 2023",4,Good. Not the Michelin starred experience I was expecting but it was lunch time. Food was interesting and fresh. Wine was OK. Staff was gracious but the experience wasn’t top notch for the money. Would recommend for a lunch or a new food experience but not for a special occasion.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 6, 2023",5,"We always come to casa mono for special occasion dinners. The food, wine, and service are fantastic. Great meal every time!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 3, 2023",4,"Overall it was good experience. Restaurant is very cute and cozy.would it rated higher if wasn’t for the server that told us the kitchen is very small so when you order you need to order everything at the same time, tapas and main courses. For me is all about the experience so I would prefer to enjoy the food and the restaurant and I felt kind on a hurry."
Traveller,"Dined on January 3, 2023",4,"Expected the food to be a bit better but overall, it was good."
RGCC,"Dined on January 2, 2023",4,Excellent food.  Service was average.
JathyniaG,"Dined on December 31, 2022",3,"This was not a Michelin star for our group of 4’s taste buds and we are foodies from Florida and California. This was a decent restaurant with some Tapas style menu options. Presentation and service was good as expected at Michelin star location but the food taste was just not a wow experience. Croquettes of Bacalao were way too strong of the fish taste it overpowered the rest, the skirt steak was 6 slices of medium done steak over peppers and onions in a small skillet ($35) and the ox piquillo peppers were 2 tiny peppers with loads of oil and some tiny pieces of meat and seasoning. ($34) the best two tapas that we enjoyed was the fideos & mackerel. Overall for the price and food quality its a 3 star."
MaryC,"Dined on December 31, 2022",3,Salt is important to flavor. Most of the dishes lacked salt and proper execution. Items remade came back spitefully over salted.
miker,"Dined on December 31, 2022",5,"We were lucky to get a last minute reservation for my wife’s birthday by sitting in the little pavilion. Obviously, we didn’t get to see the chefs at work, but it was much quieter (and perhaps healthier with less diners inside), so we enjoyed our conversation and took our time with the meal.  The sommelier did a terrific job selecting the right bottle for our palette, while also firing the dishes in an order that didn’t leave us overly sated.  The food was divine, and we tried seven dishes — each of which was better than the last. The pig belly, pigs ears, scallops, goat confit, and skirt steak were my favorites.  Five stars!"
MatthewK,"Dined on December 31, 2022",4,"Food was phenomenal, couldn’t recommend enough. Goat dish and pork belly were the stars but everything was memorable. Service on the other hand needs improvement. Over 2.5 hours for a two person lunch is excessive. It wasn’t that we’re given time to not feel rushed, it was just disorganized. Also had to ask for water refill several times which shouldn’t occur at a Michelin started restaurant. Highly recommend just clear your schedule. Remember the food, not the service."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 30, 2022",5,"First time in a while I have dined at a starred restaurant and didn’t feel like I was getting ripped off. Dishes and service danced very well together. Reminder to myself to get the scallops again. Thank you for a lovely night, Casa Mono!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 29, 2022",5,"This is our 4th date to casa mono. Casa Mono is by far our number one restaurant my partner and i have ever tried to date, and we’d like to consider ourselves food critiques and casa mono never ceases to amaze with it’s menu. Though, this last visit was a bit off. We had a reservation for 9:30, and close to closing yes, but still open nonetheless. The service felt slightly rushed with the entrées. Not by a lot but noticiable. Food 10/10 like always"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 22, 2022",2,"After booking a table inside on OpenTable we were told we had to eat outside when we arrived. It’s a pleasant enough space that allows for easier table conversation, but it was not what we booked and does not have the atmosphere of the main restaurant.  The service was good, when we could find them … to replace cutlery that was taken away with plates, to get another round of drinks, to pay the bill.  The food was very good but is overpriced for tapas sized portions."
LisaA,"Dined on December 22, 2022",5,"Wow! What a phenomenal culinary experience! We spent 5 days in Manhattan and dined at several wonderful restaurants, but Casa Mono proved to be our favorite ! The food was exquisite, the atmosphere was comfortable , and the service was exceptional! Our favorite dishes included the octopus, the pork, and the everything!! In other words, we loved it all!"
JamesW,"Dined on December 18, 2022",5,Outstanding food with a wide range of options. And the service was excellent.
YUVALA,"Dined on December 17, 2022",1,"The service was poor, we were ignored most of the time.  When we got up to smoke straight away they wanted to bring us the bill (felt like they wanted us to leave) we were a couple who came to eat at a Michelin restaurant we had heard about.  We were not even asked if the dishes were tasty to us.  We didn't eat the dish and they didn't even care.  We expected much more from a Michelin restaurant.  The attitude, the food, everything was just bad.  It is not clear how this restaurant has a Michelin star."

EsGar25,"Dined on December 4, 2022",5,First time eating at a Michelin star restaurant and the experience was great. Food was unique and delightful.
Taste,"Dined on December 4, 2022",5,"I come here frequently for a business lunch and recently came on a late weekend afternoon for wine and some small plates with friends. While getting a weekday reservation indoors for lunch is not difficult I was surprised to find that same week reservations for dining indoors even at 4pm were, so plan in advance if you want that experience. The razor clams are always excellent, one of my favorites on the menu, but everything was good. The sauce with the shishito peppers is creamy and delicious and even the simple patatas bravas with smoked paprika feels special here."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 2, 2022",3,Average food considering the price. Service was very so so as well. Music a little too loud too in my opinion.

Our favorite was the scallops, closely followed by the duck. A very special meal!"

realtyrob,"Dined on November 18, 2022",5,"Our reviews had over 17 million views so far this year.  We do not get paid we just love to eat and have fun.  We really loved Casa Mono.  5th time we ate there and always fantastic.  This time we had our favorites and a few new ones.  Must haves are the burrata and figs app.  Great homemade burrata and super sweet figs.  Clams with the noodle thingys on top are awesome and it is a lot of food.  Razor clams char grilled are great with a lovely citrus sauce to die for.  Pigs ears are really good and not a normal dish you see anywhere else.  Love the steak but they have a different word for it I'm not sure what it is.  Sliced and served over some red sauce and has sweet onions and or beets on top.  Really awesome.  For dessert you must get the bread pudding served in a iron skillet.  This is NOT on the menu and you must know about it to get it.  We love to sit at the bar down next to the Chef and watch all the food come out.  You can see how picky the Chef is about each dish and that is one of the reasons they have a Michelin Star.  Great bar too with great drinks.  Check out all of our reviews. If we do not like it we do no review it so all of the ones you see are places that are fantastic. Follow us if you like. We had over over 17 million views in 2022 and we thank you for that. We don't get paid, we just love to eat.

They won't let you order the menu in parts, make sure you check the menu a few times before you order if you're hungry.

I don’t eat cucumbers at all and it was a lovely dish well balanced. The mussels were another of my favorite dishes, loved the chorizo and the fresh es of the mussels. We also order the bone marrow blew my mind with the flavors, no words to explain how delicious it was.  Antonio our server was very nice and caring about our experience. I am definitely coming back for a full dinner and more friends"
JHBB,"Dined on November 13, 2022",2,Very dissapointed for a 1 michelin star restaurant. the food and service never reached the level of other 1 star Michelin star we visited. you ecpect the food to be of higher quality and the service outstanding.  the croquetas where mediocre at best. you expect that a Spanish staple like this would come out perfect. They clearly can not handle the ammount of customers.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 5, 2022",5,Excellent ambience. We heard about this restaurant in a newspaper review in Puerto Rico. As puertorrican we want to taste the flavors created by one of our chefs and in a mind time met him. Flavors don’t disappoint us and yesss the chef comes to our table to said hi. That’s was a special moments for us. If you are in NY take time to visit Casa Mono to enjoy an unforgettable tasty food.
Cici0406,"Dined on November 2, 2022",1,"I would say it is uncomfortable experience for me and my family members when we visited Casa Mono as second time.  I invited my family members join the lunch together in Casa Mono this Wednesday, I told them that I really have a good experience in this restaurant and the food are so so amazing. I still remembered when I celebrated my birthday with my friend. The waiters are super welcomed, helpful and engaged.  However the waiter doesn’t introduce herself, she asked if it’s first time visit the restaurant and I say no. We decided to order 4 appetizers and 4 main courses to share. But we got 5 appetizers? I don’t know why there is extra one? We truly don’t know what happens until I saw the bill. I guess maybe we all misunderstood each other? Also I asked her any recommendations, she just gave the names, didn’t explain why it’s good or special. Plus the bread was cold and not fresh, the food quality and amount wasn’t as great as last visit. When we asked paper napkins for so many times, it was so difficult to have it. The waiters are super cold, no smiles. I wish I can pay without the tips, we don’t really get the service what we should get.  Will never ever visit again."

ProudImmigrant,"Dined on October 22, 2022",4,We went on a Saturday late afternoon and it wasn’t too crowded . We were seated right away. The food was delicious. We had the razor clams which were nice and big . I personally love the creamy egg with uni and walnut. It was very creamy and tasty. We also tried their foie gras and I felt the sauce was just too sweet. Finally we tried the bone marrow which was prepared perfectly . The service could be better . I had to ask for water couple of times and also the tables are just too small!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 17, 2022",1,"One of the most terrible experiences I had in a while in terms of service, price and experience overall. Eg. our server recommended way too much for minimum order portion, we had to take 1/3 of our order home, and this was a ‘need to order all at once upfront’ request. Too many long waits in between plates. Server and hall manager misunderstood our question and made assumptions regarding seat changes, which was completely it relevant, confusing and condescending. I would not dine here again, nor recommend this restaurant. The taste of the overpriced food was not even good enough to make up for the bad experience we had.   Unfortunate."
dlowineanddine,"Dined on October 16, 2022",4,Good and Service we’re delicious. It’s small and a little crowded but the outdoor seating is nice. The waitstaff was attentive but not intrusive and the food was good and was coursed out nicely for tapas.

I will not recommend this restaurant at all … ( they do have a very good jabugo 5 Jotas , but other than that , is not worth the visit )"
SJOBklyn,"Dined on October 8, 2022",2,"A slightly sad first post covid return to one of our faves. We were stuck in a corner and honestly “out of site, out of mind” has never felt more appropriate. At one stage I was calling after a waiter who had been serving at the next table two feet away from me to ask for our water to be topped up and was totally blanked. Even the folks at the next table were shaking their heads at our predicament and saying “they can’t see you there!” Empty glasses aside, the food came in irregular waves. Dessert took forever (my piping hot cappuccino was tepid before it arrived) and then when a waiter finally put it in front of us, a manger was screaming “no!!” at him because I guess it was supposed to have a candle in it to celebrate my wife’s birthday. One waiter only said the words “you done?” to us as he hurried us (and our neighbours) to finish courses, and then swept a pile of crumbs and debris straight into my son’s lap. Plates were cleared away too quickly, the pacing was just wrong, we managed to feel both rushed and neglected at the same time. The music was too loud in our corner of the room so we had to shout to be heard, and most importantly the food just wasn’t as good as it used to be. I spoke to the maitre d’ and a manager on the way out and they said they’d make it up to us “next time”, but I’m not sure there’ll be a next time."
MichaelH,"Dined on October 5, 2022",5,We visited CASA Mini in our last night in NYC and could not be happier… The small plates were filling and delicious. Even took them off on dessert which is a rare day for us. HIGHLY recommend giving this M1⭐️ a visit

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 26, 2022",2,"We had family in from Canada. We went there and were very disappointed. Sat us outside when tables avail inside. Host was rude and dismissed me. Waiter told us to order 12 dishes for 4 people, way too much food. Another waiter came later at the end and said it always like 8-12 dishes for 4 people. So we were oversold and couldn’t finish the mediocre food. And the ambience in the outside venue was not nice. Very plain and ugly. Overall a bad experience and very expensive. Won’t be returning again."
lare,"Dined on September 25, 2022",2,"The restaurant opened late and the hostess was somewhat unwelcoming, pointing at a table to show us where it was instead of taking us to it.  Server was annoyed by our presence and basically told us we could not order more than once, everything needed to be in at the same time.  When I asked if we could order more if we were still hungry after we were finished with the tapas, he said it messes up and slows down the kitchen, and stated ‘but I can’t stop you’.  When delivering our last 2 of five dishes, he made it a point to say these are your last plates when setting them down.  Trying to get our drinks and water refilled proved to be a chore.  The pan con tomato was served on dense Cuban bread and extremely over seasoned.  The oxtail stuffed peppers were also over seasoned.  The pork meatballs had not a touch of seasoning in them and we didn’t eat them.  Portions were small, overpriced and poorly executed.  The terrible food, coupled with the poor service makes my decision not to return easy."
GusK,"Dined on September 23, 2022",5,"The food, service, wine list and ambiance was Out of this world.   The kitchen counter is the best place to sit without any doubt."
Nina,"Dined on September 21, 2022",4,"Casa Mono has a lovely menu, however since the restaurant has a Michelin star and is pretty expensive, we did expect better.  The manchego salad, crudo fish and lamb were very good. But the shishito peppers and the garlic mushrooms were nothing special.  In fact the mushrooms really weren't good. It seemed like jarred garlic was used and that the mushrooms did not cook properly. I have had Spanish mushrooms and garlic many times and these just did not stack up to those you can get at the most basic Spanish tapas places. Service was fine."
JenM,"Dined on September 19, 2022",3,"Some of the food was really good! The duck, shishito peppers and pulpo were tasty.  I asked for my skirt steak rare and got raw but seared on the outside.  Bread pudding was great!  Service was great at the beginning but dropped off at the end."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 18, 2022",4,It’s been several years since visiting Casa Mono but it’s still holding up well. We dined outside so noise level was low (inside it’s quite loud). Food is still quite terrific - tho not as extraordinary as I recall from the past. Service is first rate. Overall still a great dining experience. Highly recommended.
MandyN,"Dined on September 18, 2022",5,"wow!! we had a spectacular dinner at Casa Mono. Fernando, our server helped us by picking the menu and making excellent wine recommendations! it was so nice to sit back relax and enjoy a meal without needing to think or make decisions.  We especially loved the pork belly and scallop dishes as well as the creme brûlée dessert   The outdoor shed could maybe use a fan or something as the air felt a little still but overall was still nice. Love the open kitchen inside the restaurant we will definitely make our reservation there next time!"

BiancaB,"Dined on September 9, 2022",2,"My husband and I were unfortunately quite disappointed at our dinner, with the food being the exception. We were sat out on the street in the booth, which i can confidently say was quite terrible, when i booked outside i expected to sit on the street where you have the city ambience in fresh air! No ambiance in the box what so ever, with the A/C blaring. I asked our waiter if we could sit inside and he said no. I asked our waiter to turn off the A/C, he said yes then pretended to do it, so it was still running. So i asked another server to turn it off and finally he did. The food was all yummy, nothing to complain about there however i think the whole experience and the price we paid for a small meal was far too extreme purely because of how terrible our seating spot was. I expected more and would only ever go back if i was inside which is very cute, lively and full of ambience."

LTBK,"Dined on September 7, 2022",3,"We ate at Casa Mono to celebrate an anniversary. It's historically been one of our favorite restaurants. The service felt very rushed and vaguely impatient. They were always trying to take away a plate before we were done with it or bringing new dishes when we weren't done with the earlier ones. We felt pressured to eat faster. Once we were finished though, no one came to take our payment until we flagged someone down. The food was mixed. Everything seemed to be done with much less care than in the past and it felt like a very different experience. There was no relaxing with a glass of wine, it was an eat and get out energy."
AmandaP,"Dined on September 7, 2022",5,Lovely ambiance and delicious food! Will be back to try out the desserts next time. Thank you!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 4, 2022",2,I have been several times in Casa Mono but I see that the service now is not good. We ordered some appetizers and the table next to us that came later got their appetizer before us.   Then our main course was cold and was not good at all.   It’s a shame it used to be a good Restorant.
Marius,"Dined on September 4, 2022",3,"Great food, great Sommelier. We were are little disappointed because of the service this time: 1. After we got water our waiter was lost for 20 minutes. Didn’t get olives or bread like the other tables.  2. We were asked to order all it once so they would pace it out. This was not what we planned for so we decided to go with 3 dishes. We had a small table and as we felt the three dishes arrived nearly the same time so we had not enough space. Afterwards we ordered one by one which was only possible because the table was not reserved. 3. We had a very unfortunate table in the corner (which is nice) but the AC was blowing so hard that the hair were moving. Unfortunately it was not possible to slow it down or turn it of. 4. Next to our table we had friends of the kitchen staff which was nice. They did get dishes which looked pretty amazing but there were not available on request.   The positives: 1. Sommelier was great and took care of us when the waiter was lost whenever he was able to. We had also a nice bottle of cava and some wines by the glass 2. The food is just delicious. Salad, Fluke, razor clams, skirt steak and the phenomenal bread pudding 🤤🤤  So all in all our experience compared to our first visit last year was a little bit disappointing due to the cold atmosphere (AC) and parts of the service. Food is perfect tough."

MelD,"Dined on September 4, 2022",5,"I was visiting New York for a few days with a friend who wanted to check out some fine dining during our trip. After looking at reviews and available tables/ bookings, we chose Casa Mono as it is one of the more affordable 1-Michelin star restaurants. Since we weren't too hungry (we had big brunches and our Casa Mono reservation was at 6.15pm), we only ordered 3 dishes: razor clams, bone marrow and lamb belly. We also got some red wine to share. The razor clams arrived first, then they gave us some crudo on the house as the kitchen was running a bit behind with our other dishes. The crudo turned out to be one of our 2 favorite dishes! (My other favorite is the razor clams, my friend's is the lamb belly.)   Lovely restaurant (it's fairly small and intimate), friendly service, reasonably priced and not terribly difficult to get a reservation compared to other Michelin starred restaurants. Would come back if I'm back in New York!"
JoseP,"Dined on September 3, 2022",5,"Excellent staff! Our sommelier provided very reasonable options to complement our orders, down to the sherry flight! Plates were served promptly and with just the right progression so we never felt overwhelmed or rushed.

Becky,"Dined on September 2, 2022",1,"We went for a birthday dinner and was expecting nice food, warm service. We didn't get either. The food was expensive compared to its peers in the city, and the service was terrible. We waited at the table for more than 5 minutes before we got water, menu or anything. The wait between dishes was quite long and the server didn't apologize at all when they kept us waiting for so long, when they almost spilt water on my phone, when they dropped the bill at the table with a big bang. We wouldn't expect this level of service for a Michelin star restaurant."
Yousef,"Dined on September 1, 2022",3,"Service was great and the food was creative but a little fatty.  My wife and I had dinner at Casa Mono for her birthday. We booked it because it had a Michelin star and was nearby. The service was good but they didn’t do anything special for her birthday. The food was creative, cooked perfectly, and was served hot and was appropriately spaced out. The only issue was that the flavors were too strong for us or not cooked to our preference. For example, we would have preferred the duck more well (instead of medium rare), the pork belly was incredibly smoky without something fresh / acidic to balance it out, and the fish croquettes had an odd mushy texture we didn’t like.  It wasn’t for us but others might like it. We just expected more given the star and the price."

DonnaM,"Dined on August 26, 2022",2,"I was surprised at how mediocre the food was. I hate to say it because I really wanted to like this place. It was recommended to me, but it really fell short. We got the uni and eggs - seriously lacking salt and the uni had no flavor! The mussels were so underwhelming too. The flavors just weren't there, they were not complex at all. The chorizo crumbles did not add anything to the mussels either. Only thing I enjoyed was the fluke crudo, but that dish alone did not make up for the whole meal. Wine was good, service was great. But it's super pricey and unfortunately, not worth it. Sorry, Casa Mono!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 10, 2022",5,"Good quality food , nice service"
Vincent,"Dined on July 7, 2022",5,"Great Pulpo & Scallops, The Food is Great as Always"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 4, 2022",5,Date. It was a little too loud but the food was really good.
AlexB,"Dined on July 3, 2022",5,A wonderful dinner. As good as it has always been.
Claudia,"Dined on June 29, 2022",5,"We had a wonderful time!  The food was outstanding, as usual.  The server was knowledgeable about the menu and able to recommend what and how much to order for sharing.  The sommelier was also excellent and introduced us to a traditional style Spanish wine that we adored.   We will be going back soon."
TravelAce,"Dined on June 29, 2022",4,"The food was, as expected, absolutely wonderful. The server and staff were friendly, professional, and quick. I was disappointed that I was basically put in a box on the street with the AC not turned on til I was seated there, in the middle of summer, even though there were tables that remained empty on the sidewalk and in the restaurant itself during my entire meal. Really it kinda marred the rest of the experience… but as noted the food/drink were wonderful and the staff was friendly when they’d visit me sitting all alone in my hot box on the street."
LaurieS,"Dined on June 28, 2022",5,"We were seated in the outdoor covered section and it was like sitting in a private dining room. It was cozy, air conditioned and not as noisy. We were disappointed at first that we would not be in the main restaurant? But we’re pleasantly surprised how much we enjoyed the space!"
takechan,"Dined on June 27, 2022",1,"The food was surprisingly terrible.  Three 1.5-inch scallops cost over $ 30.  When I went the other day, I was poking four.  I'm not good at grilling duck.  The food is not stable."
StacyJ,"Dined on June 27, 2022",3,Kjust super busy and kitchen got way backed up and good came out late and one at a time.
PraveenG,"Dined on June 26, 2022",5,A great Spanish restaurant with flavorful food! Amazing wine selection as well!
EmmaG,"Dined on June 26, 2022",1,"The food was insanely overpriced and not good. The wait staff was rude, when we asked for menu suggestions the waiter fired off a bunch of things in an almost comically fast speed and was frustrated when asked to repeat one of the dishes he listed. Also rolled his eyes at another point and acted like we were inconveniencing  him throughout the meal. Had to ask repeatedly for our water to be refilled on a hot day. I never write reviews but this was just SO BAD. Don’t goo"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 24, 2022",5,"A great afternoon meal - good wines, bone marrow a must!"
IvanG,"Dined on June 24, 2022",4,Excellent food.  Great variety. Great presentation.  Fabulous wine selection.  Juan the wine expert was very attentive and knowledgeable.  Service was a bit slow as the waiter had too many tables under his watch.  This was mentioned to us by the waiter himself.
LindseyH,"Dined on June 21, 2022",3,"I asked for an outdoor table in the reservation, and we were placed outdoors, but in a little building on the street. It was noisy and hot and felt like we were having a fancy dinner in a portable classroom. I asked whether we could be moved to an actual outdoor table and was told that there was no space. The ambience was pretty disappointing."
Luvfood,"Dined on June 19, 2022",3,The food disappointed despite the Michelin star. Bone marrow was scant and I did not see the beauty in a fish egg topping… the potatoes brava were soggy. The charcuterie was fatty   Lovely spot. Amazing basque wine. Great service. So…. Would choose food selections differently were we to return.
JuancitoCaminador,"Dined on June 18, 2022",5,Highly recommended by a restaurateur friend did not disappoint. We chose 4 plates which were perfectly timed to arrive to our table as we finished savoring each previous one. Do allow yourself time to discover the flavors of each dish. Great wine list!
EddieS,"Dined on June 18, 2022",5,"We booked a date night reservation before seeing a live music show and could not have picked a better place.  Our table outside was in a great location with a pleasant view of the neighborhood.  Our server, Ana D, was friendly, fun and super knowledgeable about all of the menu items and her wine knowledge was superb.  We would highly recommend!"
Elinak,"Dined on June 17, 2022",5,"Fantastic experience all around. Delicious, cozy, attentive"
AntolDargi,"Dined on June 13, 2022",4,"The ambience of Casa Mono is wonderfully European, I felt transported from the general NYC restaurant vib. They give you real menus! We had high hopes for the food but three of the dishes pictured on the website menu, which we hoped to order were not being served (... and we got three different reasons for why the dishes were not available). The scallops were served first and very good, but from there it went down hill. Patatas Bravas, so loved by my husband during our summer in Barcelona, were a far cry form even tasting like potatoes and it was not because of the intense smoked paprika sauce rather the way the potatoes were cooked, dried out and devoid of their flavor.  We were surprised and disappointed. The three small pork Albondigas were flavorful sitting in a heavy sauce which my husband liked.  We ordered the peppers stuffed with oxtails which also didn't hit the mark; only two, not three,  small shrunken peppers without much oxtail, swimming in a sweet, not savoy, sauce. I liked my vino blanco recommended by the waiter, and the Crema Catalana had a fantastic burnt sugar flavor.  The service was very good all around.  I would go back for the ambience, but also call the day of to make sure the dishes listed on the menu are actually being served.  xoxo"
HUIZ,"Dined on June 12, 2022",5,Everything is delicious and unique as always!
Giovanni,"Dined on June 11, 2022",5,The food was beyond great. The staff added the finishing touch to a spectacular dining experience!
Hoockie,"Dined on June 10, 2022",4,Food was good. We were sat outside so felt a little forgotten about on the service front but good overall
SherryL,"Dined on June 9, 2022",5,Tapas are delicious with outstanding quality. Antonio is very friendly and provides good wine suggestions.  We had a wonderful anniversary lunch and definitely will go back again.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 7, 2022",3,Long delay on the last three dishes (all dishes were ordered at the sane time)
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 6, 2022",5,The food was good. My friend is allergic to shellfish and so somewhat limited because I love the Razors and the mussels.  The pork belly was good!  The pulpo was disappointing. Very little pulpo (more like a fennel salad) and could taste it as it was smashed and thin.  The rest was all good.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 6, 2022",5,"Outstanding , great food, ambiance."
yumyum255,"Dined on June 5, 2022",2,Not worth the Michelin star ... food was very uneven ... some great but some not ... service was underwhelming ... for the price and star definitely not what we expected.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 2, 2022",5,Casa Mono never disappoints. The sommelier was great but our server though present just didn’t seem like he could be bothered.
Ernesto,"Dined on May 30, 2022",5,"As always, simply the best tapas available in New York City"
Hubert,"Dined on May 30, 2022",2,"Greasee, bad taste combinations. Bad ambiance; you can tell the staff is unhappy."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 30, 2022",5,We can’t stop coming here. Always new small plates to try that blow us away each time. And the wine list is endless. Perfect for an outdoor summer meal
anvasqu,"Dined on May 29, 2022",4,"The food was scrumptious but the service was awful. We were seated outside so not sure if that had to do with it. We had to go inside to fetch our server twice. At some point during our meal our table was full of dirty dishes that no one had picked up. The server passed by and instead of taking some of the dishes, he said he would send someone to pick them up ( another 10 mins). To be a one star Michelin restaurant, the service was sub-par."
mofau,"Dined on May 29, 2022",5,The food is fantastic. Interesting flavors. I wanted to order everything on the menu! One of best meals ever. I love this spot!
BernardE,"Dined on May 29, 2022",3,2 hour meal. Innovative attempts but many of the dishes don’t ultimately come together. A bit surprisingly given it’s Michelin Star.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 28, 2022",2,Not worth it. Service was very poor and unfriendly. Won’t be going again.
Daniel,"Dined on May 28, 2022",5,"Amazing food and flavours, great wine selection. Recommended"
YaelD,"Dined on May 26, 2022",5,As usual we enjoyed our dining experience and were very satisfied.
KevinL,"Dined on May 26, 2022",5,Food was amazing as always and the wine experience was even better than usual!
DavidWV,"Dined on May 22, 2022",5,"Excellent. 3rd time visiting. Quick food service, fitting wine recommendations, lovely neighborhood and outdoor seating."
JuanMartinez,"Dined on May 21, 2022",5,El mejor restaurante Español en Manhattan.
Bsmo,"Dined on May 19, 2022",3,I have had a lot of Spanish food and this place is pretty average. Wouldn’t be an issue if they charged accordingly but for the price you can do a lot better. They do have fantastic olive oil though.
SharonF,"Dined on May 18, 2022",5,Food is absolutely delicious. Charming ambience and professional service.
PalomaM,"Dined on May 18, 2022",5,"Outside is very cool, but with wind it’s better with a sweat but very cool & romantic for 2 people ! Inside more intimiste   Food 20/20 Wine 20/20 Service 20/20 People 20/20 Perfect ! A real surprise food is unbelievable !!!"
SheilaT,"Dined on May 16, 2022",5,Menu was interesting and everything was an explosion of flavor in your mouth.
KiranK,"Dined on May 15, 2022",2,Very disappointed with our waiter and his attitude. Prior experiences were great. This guy didn’t seem to think customers needed to be treated with a moniker of respect.
Nacho,"Dined on May 15, 2022",1,"The service was poor in general. The waitress misled us on recommendations, forcing us to take 2 or 3 plates per person regardless of how hungry were we.  The quality of the plates was pretty bad, and will not pass the review of any Spanish person. For example, the pan con tomate, was a super basic appetizer; the bread was hard/old, and the tomato and olive were not right. This place would not survive the review of a Spanish person based on the receipts, quality of the food, and overall service (5/14/2022)."
JohnA,"Dined on May 14, 2022",5,"Great experience-sat outside, so noise was not a factor. Service was attentive and made solid recommendations from the diverse menu. The sommelier helped pick out a perfect wine to pair with a variety of the tapas items (2014 Lacima Rabeira Sacra, medium bodied, mineral, highly recommend). Shishito peppers, scallops, pork belly and skirt steak were all very flavorful and generous portions for tapas. We will be back!"
MegK,"Dined on May 14, 2022",5,We had an absolutely wonderful time celebrating my sister’s bachelorette. The servers were so helpful and really made the experience worthwhile. The food is to die for. I’d recommend to anyone who is looking for a great date night or a cute place for light bites.
EricZ,"Dined on May 8, 2022",3,Food quality was uneven. Some dishes were too greasy and over-flavored
MelissaM,"Dined on May 8, 2022",4,The food was good but a bit underwhelming - we came in with high expectations.
Disappointed,"Dined on May 8, 2022",3,Poor Quality of the service requires immediate management attention
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 7, 2022",4,"We just didn't love the food... I was nostalgic for Spanish tapas but a few dishes seemed to miss the mark. I wasn't a fan of the mayo and it was on almost every dish -- croquetas, fideos, bone marrow, meatballs. Also simple dishes like patatas bravas were trying to be too up-leveled when all I desired were crispy fried potatoes to dip in a combo of mayo and red sauce. Instead they were roasted and doused in a tomato sauce that was just too over powering. We ate one and let the rest sit.   Pan con tomate and fideos were the 2 dishes out of 6 we enjoyed. I don't think the food is bad, it just wasn't taking me back to my time in Spain and that's why I just didn't love it. Maybe we ordered the wrong things or maybe we my memories of tapas are faulty..."
Portia,"Dined on May 6, 2022",4,"The food is wonderful and the place is charming. It is very pricey, with generally small portions. The people working there are lovely but they may be under-staffed (like everywhere), we had to beg a waiter to take our order. They were very classy when we stayed chatting for a long time."
KarimE,"Dined on May 3, 2022",5,"Person welcoming was not a pleasure to work with, he told me to wait outside for the second person of a party of 2 while the restaurant was empty and the table was free, never experienced at casa mono before"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 1, 2022",5,Everything was amazing!
RonaldM,"Dined on April 27, 2022",5,"Superb in every way Award winning menu,  Wait staff and wine list"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 20, 2022",5,"Great place, amazing food."
MSBP,"Dined on April 19, 2022",3,"Excellent service, average food, good if you like sauces and strong flavours, bad if you hate garlic"
BrianE,"Dined on April 18, 2022",2,"For a Michelin-starred restaurant, the service was very poor - we were handed cutlery directly rather than it being placed on the table, courses were not explained, a number of dishes were not available, sides of patatas bravas were not delivered until ten minutes after all other dishes were finished despite us asking for them earlier, and there were other issues. The food itself was fine without being outstanding. We were sat outside and felt somewhat forgotten by the staff. It is not the equivalent of starred restaurants we have eaten in before, and in many ways is quite far from it. Our last meal in a starred restaurant was twice the price but ten times the experience."
ronald,"Dined on April 18, 2022",5,we asked about a dish that wasn't on the menu and our server checked on it for us. we were able to order it and really enjoyed it
LeonardoM,"Dined on April 18, 2022",1,"The worst service in a starred Michelin restaurant. The waiter took our order and disappear, when asked the manager about it, he responded arrogantly: what is problem? . We repeated the waiter never came back, and again responded what is your problem. Unacceptable attitude of any restaurant. Shame because we liked the place and had been there many times. Michelin take your name from this establishment"
JoseC,"Dined on April 17, 2022",5,"Amazing expirience, Food Delicious  and the service was increddible. Timing of the Tapas an order was excelent."
kimichurri,"Dined on April 16, 2022",5,"Casa Mono has amazing tapas and an unpretentious vibe.  My husband and I came in on a Friday night that was perfect for outdoor seating, but since our reservations were for indoors, we just stuck with it--which turned out to be the right decision as we got to sit right next to the open tapas kitchen (and I love watching all the action).  The host was very courteous and accommodated us despite being early.  Our server was engaged and always ready for us.  She even offered to have the sommelier speak to me even if it was just me drinking for the night.  The sommelier was likely very engaging and knowledgeable, and offered me a red wine that was just what I was looking for from their noteworthy and expansive wine list.  Our table was never crowded or cluttered as it was bussed with perfect timing.  Now, onto the food.  A small plate of bread and olives are on the house to start, and they'll give more if requested.  We began with a plate of jamon serrano--our standard pick at every tapas place.  In addition to this, we got the crudo fluke, the duck egg with black truffle, the lamb belly, and foie gras with cinco cebollas.   They were are all great and flavorful, however, it was the razor clams ala plancha and fideos over clams that stole the show.  Both are a must-try.  The menu had a whole lot more tapas I wanted to try, but we were already full by the end of our course.  Because we were full, we decided to skip dessert.  Perhaps next time we can try some!  We are definitely coming back!"
PriyankaD,"Dined on April 14, 2022",5,The best restaurant experience in NY. Service was extraordinary!

LuisF,"Dined on March 31, 2022",1,"Just bad quality Spanish food. None of the things order were very good. Croquetas really average, the 50$ jamón pata negra was really disappointing and not even close to what can be expected. Little Spain is so much better…"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 19, 2022",5,"So great! Best razor ever had. Foie gras reached Michelin level, despite its a tapas. A little bit upset that bone marrow was sold out, but overall the restaurant is outstanding that gives me a good experience simply by well designed tapad"

passionnate,"Dined on March 18, 2022",5,"Had a great time here. We ordered several things off the menu and everything we had was delicious. My favorites were the egg with uni, confit goat, and sobrasada. We sat outside and they seemed to forget about us - took us a while to get refills on water and about 30 minutes to get our check."

ClydeT,"Dined on March 6, 2022",5,"I’ve been to Casa Mono Mono dozens of times. It has never disappointed me. The food is perfectly prepared and the service is excellent.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 6, 2022",5,We absolutely love it here.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 5, 2022",5,Great sommelier service and food was excellent
NDAS,"Dined on March 5, 2022",3,A nice Spanish restaurants by all accounts but this was the noisiest and least worthy of a star Michelin restaurant we went to. All waiters were nice but some were not wearing masks.  The food was good but not exceptional. Tables were too close to each other and seating was generally uncomfortable. Only the wine deserves some credit.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 4, 2022",5,The food is the best.  The service and host were just epic.  We had such a good time.
ScottC,"Dined on March 3, 2022",5,Very quaint European Dining experience. Enjoyed the  menu variety and the extensive wine list. Very much recommend.
Artfreak,"Dined on March 2, 2022",5,Everything was perfect. The server was attentive and knowledgeable. The noontime vibe of a place for locals was attractive. The plates were original and wonderful.

RobertoE,"Dined on February 28, 2022",5,It felt like a trip to Spain.  Simply extraordinary.

Douglas,"Dined on February 24, 2022",5,"Always a pleasure. Food is invariably delicious and the staff could not be friendlier or attentive while not being intrusive.

Ian94,"Dined on February 21, 2022",5,"Family visit from CA. Great food and wine. Excellent service. Thanks, again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 21, 2022",2,"Unfortunately, had very poor service here. Sat us very late on top of the reservation we made and the food came way too slow. Instead of offering us a seat at the bar or another table to wait at, they made us stand in the cold. I have been here a couple of times, but this time will make me reconsider."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 21, 2022",5,Casa mono is absolutely spectacular. Every dish we had was simply off the charts. The servers and staff were excellent!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 21, 2022",5,The best tapas in NYC. Tough reservation to get but worth it.

michael,"Dined on February 15, 2022",4,Nice Vibe and open air kitchen.  Lots of wine choices.
AgnesL,"Dined on February 15, 2022",5,My husband and I came here for an early dinner on Valentine’s Day. The dishes are tapa-style and meant to be shared. Everything we ordered and tried was absolutely delicious and flavorful. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable and accommodating. I would definitely recommend and would definitely return.
Letseat,"Dined on February 14, 2022",4,"The food is straight up excellent. The location is tight, tables are tight, it’s the “math” of the area.  Prices are fair to slightly expensive for the quality and portion size. You will drop $60pp min.  On past visits the serving staff had an air of refined professionalism and “investment” in the experience.  This time hiring issues may have affected quality of the personnel and their comportment. Service was fine but nothing special. We enjoyed each other and the experience. Again, the dishes are delicious and special. $145 for two including one drink each, no dessert."
Joshua,"Dined on February 14, 2022",4,"Great food as always! Our server was great, but the host was pretty rude. There were two open two-tops, and we were made to sit outside, despite having a reservation. A friend also had an experience with a rude host. We love the restaurant, and we plan to try it again."
NishantK,"Dined on February 14, 2022",5,We had 5 dishes and every single one was incredible. Great service by the staff as well. Definitely worth the price. Desserts could have been better.
TimB,"Dined on February 12, 2022",5,"Again unbelievable!! Best lunch in North America. Came here 13 years ago and 15 years ago. Even better today. The food just melts in your mouth.

AlexisB,"Dined on February 4, 2022",5,Absolutely delicious food! It had been a few years since my friends and I had eaten here -it's even better than we remembered.  We had a fantastic server who made dinner all the more lovely and recommended two wines that we loved.  We ordered 7-8 dishes and all were fantastic.  We will definitely be back.  We dined outdoors on a rainy night and the outdoor casita was toasty and cozy.
EmilyH,"Dined on February 4, 2022",3,"The service has really gone down hill. We were so rushed and waitress was quite rude. Staff asked if we wanted our table to be cleared no less than 10 times. I used to love Casa Mono, but I won't be back."
Gfu26,"Dined on February 2, 2022",4,"The pulpo with fennel, garlic razor clams and fideos with clams were the best.  Stay away from the bacalao croquettes-not impressed-at all."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 1, 2022",1,Horrible waitress… got rained on the entire time sitting outside
KristinM,"Dined on January 28, 2022",5,The food was excellent and our server was the best! Friendly & professional service & recommended perfect wine for our lunch
Chichi,"Dined on January 28, 2022",5,One of the best places for Spanish tapas in NYC. Went there 10 years ago and the quality is as good as ever.
Teddy,"Dined on January 28, 2022",5,Outstanding as always ! Thank you for the entire staff to keep that place such a high quality ❤️
MarieliE,"Dined on January 28, 2022",4,"Todo estuvo muy bueno. Servicio, comida. Ambiente. En general muy bueno todo"
HeranD,"Dined on January 27, 2022",4,Excellent food and service. The 4/5 stars is because the place is a bit tight on space and the heat was really too warm. Our waiter Darwin was lovely.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 26, 2022",5,As good as always.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 26, 2022",5,Seating is too tight
cila,"Dined on January 25, 2022",5,We were the only party eating outdoor in the heated shed. Perfect setting for this time.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 23, 2022",5,"Took my boyfriend for his birthday. We sat outside in the enclosed “outdoor” pods and were comfortable with both the ventilation and the cold temps thanks to heat lamps. The service was spectacular (thank you Meredith!), as was the food. Wine recos we’re also wonderful. The pulpo and bacalao croquetas with orange cream were favorites, as was the salted caramel ice cream with berries surprise birthday dessert. Everything we expected from a Michelin experience — especially appreciated in Covid times."
TimM,"Dined on January 21, 2022",5,"Buzzy, intimate, friendly"
grant,"Dined on January 20, 2022",4,"Casa Mono is a restaurant that is absolutely worth visiting. The jamon Iberico is carved and plated fantastically and is certainly the stand out dish - razor clams, meatballs and bread pudding were noteworthy as well. I made the right decision in allowing the somm to pick our bottle of wine, he made a great choice which added to the whole experience. Will be returning!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 19, 2022",5,The quality of the tapas are outstanding!
Juank,"Dined on January 17, 2022",4,Muy buena comida española en NYC. Extensa carta de vinos
NorbertW,"Dined on January 16, 2022",5,Amazing food and being able to watch everything from the chef table area was an added bonus. Highly recommended
LocalGuy,"Dined on January 14, 2022",2,Took a while to get service and for staff to give us menus. Food was ok. Tapas at Little Spain are more enjoyable and of higher quality
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 10, 2022",4,The staff unfriendy
Kimberly,"Dined on January 9, 2022",3,"Nothing special a bit overrated. Staffs are quite unprofessional. Food is fair. Besides food, a bit disappointed."
KarimE,"Dined on January 8, 2022",5,Great - as always!
BeatrizH,"Dined on January 1, 2022",5,Delicious food and fabulous service. The outside seating was heated and comfortable.
SarahT,"Dined on December 31, 2021",5,Always worth the splurge. Fideos with chorizo and clams is my absolute favorite.
Darx,"Dined on December 30, 2021",4,"The duck breast, bacalao, and sweetbread are the favorite. Wide wine selection. Ambiance is great for conversation with friend or date especially after hours when noise subsides."
alexander,"Dined on December 30, 2021",5,"Casa Mono couldn't have been more accommodating, we love them and had a wonderful evening!"
ConnieL,"Dined on December 27, 2021",5,"Great food, gourmet style."
Ariel,"Dined on December 24, 2021",4,"We where sitting outside and the heat lamps stopped working, we told the waitress and the waiter, they said they would speak to a manager and no one came after that.  We left without a main course because of the cold.  It was 32 outside.    Its a shame because the food was excellent, but this was a big foul.  Disappointed that one would experience this at a Michelin stat restaurant.  In Covid times you have to reassure consumers that outside they will have a great experience.  So trust me when i say, don't eat outside at Casa Mono if its cold."
KevinD,"Dined on December 20, 2021",4,A little bit cold and drafty as we were at the window/sliding door and there was no space heater.
dkwilson,"Dined on December 20, 2021",4,Food is excellent but not a place to go if you are looking for quiet or social distancing.  I recommend 4-5 plates to share for 2.
MBeezie,"Dined on December 19, 2021",5,"Hard to top the lovely service, incredible food and Spanish wine we had for Sunday lunch the weekend before Christmas! The complimentary Prosecco and birthday candle was a thoughtful surprise to a perfect mid day meal! Probably one of the best New York dining experiences I’ve had in years."
Mark,"Dined on December 19, 2021",4,"Food and ambiance were great as always. Service was unavailable, indifferent, and a drag on the experience. Poured and charged for the wrong wine, never checked in our courses, left beverages empty the entire meal, only came back to drop the check."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 18, 2021",5,"Very unique and interesting plates! Tapas were decent portions and menu was extensive. Would recommend the Scallops and minted cashews, and the fideos with clams and chorizo (less so the goat confit). Would definitely come back!!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 16, 2021",5,Amazing as usual. We are from Puerto Rico and we try to dine here every time we visit NYC. Delicious food. Great service.
AbWal,"Dined on December 15, 2021",5,Top tier dinner in Gramercy!!!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 15, 2021",3,The service was bad. They continue to come and want us to leave even if we haven’t finished our food:)
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 13, 2021",5,This was an amazing experience! My husband and I loved every dish and the service and atmosphere were great.
luchito,"Dined on December 13, 2021",5,Muy buen restaurante. Nos sentamos en la barra frente a la cocina donde dos chef preparaban los platos. Todo lo que pedimos -son platos pequeños- muy bien presentado y de gran factura. Servicio amable. Gran carta de vinos españoles. De lo mejor que he conocido en nyc.
Crystal,"Dined on December 10, 2021",5,My favorite restaurant in Manhattan since it’s opening 12 years ago. Perfection.
NathalieM,"Dined on December 9, 2021",5,"The food was delicious, the service outstanding. The place is cozy, but the tables were a bit too close to each other."
AdamP,"Dined on December 8, 2021",5,Spectacular. Perfect seasoning. I want to live here.
Brooke,"Dined on December 8, 2021",5,"Everything was fantastic from the food to the service. Matt was very personable with great suggestions and awesome service overall. Although I must say, we called the restaurant letting them know we were running late and when we arrived we had a not so warm welcome by the manager who continued to remind us how late we were while repeatedly telling us we will not have much time to eat and about our our time."
RonaldM,"Dined on December 8, 2021",5,"It’s true, One Michelin star, Inventive, satisfying, best!"
DenPat,"Dined on December 6, 2021",3,"Food was VG and service good (although a bit disjointed).  Music (lunch time) was so loud at first, I could not understand the person seated at my table. But it did calm down. My major complaint was the size of the table for two people.  It was just a little bigger than a snack tray and shoved up against the wall. It made dealing with the various tapas on the table along with utensils, water, wine, etc. just about impossible. It greatly detracted from the dining experience."
CaroleI,"Dined on December 5, 2021",5,"Amazing restaurant with extraordinary food.  Everything is perfectly served with a smile.  I wanted to order everything on the menu, but restrained myself."
Sarah,"Dined on December 5, 2021",5,Fabulous! Small place that creates a fun atmosphere for small groups. Food was amazing. So fun to try lots of different dishes!
NataliaR,"Dined on December 5, 2021",5,It was really good ! The service was the best
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 3, 2021",5,Nice service and good food. Really doing a good job in casual dinning. Only place with good Spanish wines
EllenW,"Dined on December 3, 2021",2,Service was slow and disorganized and the meal was excessively long. We were also expecting to be seated indoors based on the reservation information provided on opentable and then learned at the last minute that we would be forced to eat outdoors. The hostess was not helpful and even a bit rude. The whole experience was disappointing and not at all up to Michelin standards. Prices have significantly increased and felt ridiculous. The food was still good although the menu is repetitive and is in need of some innovation.   I used to love this place but no longer recommend it following my latest experience.
ParosTipota,"Dined on December 1, 2021",3,"Fantastic food, great wine, attentive service and, after the first 15 or so minutes, no music! My only reservation was that it was quite expensive. But although I do not expect to do this very often, it was a great experience and I don't regret spending the money"
robinita,"Dined on December 1, 2021",5,"Wonderful meal, terrific service, ready to go back"
Marefa,"Dined on November 28, 2021",2,If you choose a one star michelin restaurant you expect good food and an approipriate Space! Booth were not at the  rendez-vous instead we  were at the cantine serving food that you will get in a bodega in Spain for a third if the price
KaSixSixThree,"Dined on November 28, 2021",5,Would go back anytime. Good food and good wine. Also a fan of the tapas and cheese plate.
scottinobsdca,"Dined on November 27, 2021",4,The octopus was quite good and well prepared. A couple other dishes were a bit to greasy for our liking as well as too salty. It is a lovely NYC feeling location. The burrata was also pretty nice.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 27, 2021",5,Great food great service
jsdaf,"Dined on November 25, 2021",1,terrible service from the host who has a horrible manner. Didn’t feel welcome at all. Very disappointed
FoodieSA,"Dined on November 25, 2021",5,Amazing evening with an amazing meal. Highly recommend. A true gem in the city!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 24, 2021",1,"The appetizer was not chewable, the bread was over toasted, I asked for a knife to cut it and they didn’t had any at all.  The waiter told us that we could share the food but the qty of each dish is barely enough for one person.  Not sufficient heating when seating outside and the waiter is not close by, each time we needed to wait 5-10 min for him to come outside"
LeeH,"Dined on November 24, 2021",4,Excellent michellin star restaurant. I went with some family members and enjoyed a tasty reasonably priced tapas meal that was easy to get to via public transit.
JaimieL,"Dined on November 21, 2021",5,Food is delicious and creative. Interesting taste sensations and combinations. Wonderful waiter Fernando was very attentive and helpful.
MartaM,"Dined on November 21, 2021",5,Angie was a wonderful! The food was extraordinary. And the sommelier made a great recommendation for a Sherry.
AvishayD,"Dined on November 19, 2021",5,"The food was fantastic: Skirt steak,  scallops, Duck and salad all cooked or prepared for perfection.  However I miss the Pork cheeks I had a year ago. The service was easy and not overburdening. We celebrate my friend birthday. The two champagne glasses were on the house, we love this place. I live one block away. We shall be back."
Saint,"Dined on November 19, 2021",4,Perfect for two.  Interesting small environment couples with a variety of amazing dishes... I strongly recommend a wine pairing to go with a medley of flavors.
Rado,"Dined on November 17, 2021",4,One of our favorites for many years. If you like tapas you will love this place!
Sarah101,"Dined on November 16, 2021",5,Outstanding in every way! Each dish was better than the next. The seasoning was especially perfect. I love salt but I also make a note of when cuisine is over salted to make up for poor quality ingredients. This was definitely not the case at Casa Mono. Would go back 100%!
KarimE,"Dined on November 16, 2021",5,"Great, as always!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 13, 2021",5,Amazing food with a variety of flavors. Pork Soprasata and the Goat with Avocado were the top dishes we had.
123dml,"Dined on November 12, 2021",5,Just an amazing experience. Michelin star tapas in a spot you wouldn’t expect there to be a Michelin star restaurant.
JamesM,"Dined on November 9, 2021",5,"One of New York City's best restaurants never misses a beat. The refined and vivid Spanish cuisine is augmented by professional, friendly service and a stellar wine list. There's a reason Casa Mono has been around so long...bravo!"
StephanieP,"Dined on November 8, 2021",5,"Delightful, cozy Spanish tapas place in Grammercy Park.  Food was wonderful....especially recommend the scallops, the goat, and the pork belly.  Unfortunately no sangria.....?? A tapas place with no sangria?? Nevertheless, a lovely meal."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 8, 2021",5,Very knowledgeable server! Warm and Friendly! Great wine and food. Host team seemed less than thrilled to be working but other than that it was amazing. We sat in the outside hut that was amazing and warm too. Inside was deff popping and upon my next visit I’m going to try to sit I side. Thank you Meredith (our server) for making night great!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 8, 2021",5,Probably the best Spanish Tapas restaurant in the city. The food and service was outstanding. The hostess was a little rude but will not that against the fine waiters.

HeatherB,"Dined on November 3, 2021",5,"Most delicious lunch I have had in years. The outdoor seating was comfortable with heat lamps, even though the day was cold."
GeorgiaS,"Dined on November 1, 2021",5,One of my favorite restaurants. The foie gras is out of this world.
NancyA,"Dined on November 1, 2021",5,What a great place to enjoy the food and wine of Spain!
NataliaNG,"Dined on October 31, 2021",3,The steak was over cooked. It’s incredible that happens in a Michelin star restaurant. The host was rude.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 31, 2021",2,"The food was good, unfortunately the service was really bad, does not meet Michelin star quality at all."
MirelaG,"Dined on October 31, 2021",3,"Love this place, have been there more many times. Prices have increased SIGNIFICANTLY since the pandemic, but let’s say we can understand that. The sudden collapse of their customer service it is harder to comprehend. First off, we got there and were two tables available , both for two people, one very well located, one hidden, cramped and undesirable. We asked to be sited at the better one but we were  blatantly  lied to when told that a party of three was expected. No, just another couple was sited ,  but a younger one. Is there an age limit for when you get sited in the front of the restaurant ??? Service was surprisingly bad. When asked for a new plate when we changed dishes, the waitress was confused and reluctantly change them but with an air of complete disapproval. Many small restaurants have failed. I hope you take this as a sign that we want you to survive."
TSunami,"Dined on October 30, 2021",5,Amazing and inventive tapas in a very Spanish ambiance.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 30, 2021",5,"Sitting at the bar and watching the chefs at work is always a pleasure at Casa Mono. The service was incredible with a lot of attention to detail, and the food was superb, as always. The bone marrow and oxtail stuffed peppers were standouts! Might be the best bone marrow I have ever had"
HillaB,"Dined on October 28, 2021",2,"Indoor space is quite small, so a bit noisy. Food - we came with high expectations , ordered 5 different dishes, they were all not 'wow' at all. Thanks."

TK719,"Dined on October 26, 2021",5,"Wonderful dinner at Casa Mono. My frisee salad, scallops and patatas bravas were all delicious. The chocolate ganache dessert was equally superb. My server Andrew was amazing. He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and made certain that everything was perfect. Other staff members were also most helpful and professional. A terrific dining experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 23, 2021",5,The food was exquisite!!! The combinations of flavors to make that perfect bite was incredible. Add to that the fact that Chef Jonathan Melendez is a very friendly and attentive chef who makes you feel like part of the family. Totally recommended.
Brooklyn101,"Dined on October 23, 2021",5,"For folks that have never had good Spanish tapas, this is perfect!"
Shinobi,"Dined on October 22, 2021",5,Amazing as always. First place to go after flying in from LA
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 20, 2021",3,"Comida rica, con buenos ingredientes y variada, pero no tienen ningún plato sencillo o no muy aderezado.  No tienen endulzante para el café, solo azúcar regular."
Charlie,"Dined on October 20, 2021",1,"Casa Mono is one of my favorite restaurants in the city and I come here often. Had the worst experience recently, however, as we wanted to do a bottle of wine and 2-3 tapas for a first date. 930 on a Tuesday evening and the waitress informed us that is was “full-service dining only” and we would need to order more than that if we wanted to stay seated outside rather than visit the communal tables at Bar Jamon. She proceeded to clear our table and waited for us to leave after conversing with the Som (loudly) that she “was so tired of people thinking that was OK.” In fairness, every time I dine here, we typically order 2-3 bottles of wine (the Numanthia is a favorite of mine) and the service has never been anything short of exceptional. I am so disappointed with the waitress and sommelier and upset that this has left a bad taste in my mouth for a favorite of mine. This would have been more understandable if there were not tables available or even a single person waiting to be seated but truly disappointing.  Above being said, I would still recommend Casa Mono as well as Bar Jamon - though be wary that there is apparently a minimum order required now."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 20, 2021",5,Amazing service!!
ChefK,"Dined on October 20, 2021",5,"A member of our party has extreme food sensitivities that our waiter, Juan, patiently explored and accommodated."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 16, 2021",5,Lovely dinner- we had to wait an hour to be seated but the staff accommodated us.
DeniseS,"Dined on October 10, 2021",4,"Great service and ambiance! Food wise, some items like razor clams, burrata, house salad, and duck breast, were delicious while others were average (papas bravas, meatballs and duck confit).  We had a cava tasting as well and well worth it! Our waitress was very thoughtful and gave us good recommendations on what to order. Would visit again!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 10, 2021",5,Service was excellent and food was fantastic.

Waki,"Dined on October 2, 2021",4,"Great outdoor setup. Staff was very accommodating, nice and knowledgeable- food to wine. Food was good though not 100% Spanish in case that is the expectation. We had a lovely time enjoying the dishes and a great bottle wine. A couple of suggestions:  Dishes can use less salt. Some were quite salty and detracted from the taste. We feel everyone, including the somm and the host should wear a mask if they’re coning to a table to talk to customers. That was not the case. Even if you’re vaccinated, you can be a carrier, lest they forgot."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 2, 2021",5,"Went there for my birthday, the staff was very attentive and friendly. The food was amazing and surpassed all expectations."
Derek,"Dined on September 26, 2021",5,Some of the best food I’ve had in NYC.
Lizzie1234,"Dined on September 26, 2021",5,Close quarters outside. Food excellent. Jamin iberica not worth 50.00 dollars
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 25, 2021",5,Always outstanding.
BertH,"Dined on September 25, 2021",2,"Casa Mono is both expensive and no longer worth it. There are some decent dishes to be sure. The tomato bread is good. The chaucuterie platter is OK. The Iberico ham, at $50 for a small portion is what it is-if you are flush and love the taste it is fine but for many it will be an unnecessary extravagance. I didn't care for the grilled peppers in a kind of cheese sauce at all. The menu badly needs updating, the prices need to be reconsidered-$35 for a portion of skirt steak is really not appropriate, and with the coming of cooler weather, the outdoor dining terrace will no longer be a viable option. If you want Spanish food or tapas in NYC-there are other spots."
JamesM,"Dined on September 25, 2021",5,One of the city’s longstanding restaurants remains as special as always. Elegantly detailed Spanish cuisine at its best. One of the most unsung wine lists in town too. Professional service. They haven’t skipped a beat through all the travails of the pandemic either. Bravo…
DianeM,"Dined on September 25, 2021",5,Awesome experience.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 22, 2021",1,"Restaurante español donde la mujer encargada de darte la mesa dice que habla muy poco español, la comida buena pero en poca cantidad, el precio para ser Nueva York aceptable, por eso supongo que las personas que van allí tienen muy poca educación, celebrábamos el cumpleaños de mi esposa, nos dan una mesa en una esquina enfrente de la puerta, a la derecha teníamos una mesa de 4 que reían como gallinas, a la izquierda una mesa de 6 que forzaban las carcajadas, la comida es correcta, el servicio malo muy malo, esperas para pedir, entre platos y cuando llegan los postres nos traen 1 de los dos que habíamos pedidos, reclámanos el segundo, viene otro encargado que si sabía español para que le confirmemos que sólo hemos comido un postre y después de 15 minutos llega el segundo postre que evidentemente hemos rechazado, nos piden disculpas y nos descuentan el postre consumido, a la hora de pagar sorpresa no aceptan pago con teléfono, me parece increíble que en una ciudad como está todavía quede algún restaurante que no acepte pago con el teléfono, finalmente  entre el efectivo de mi mujer y el mío hemos podido pagar la cuenta de 205$. Evidentemente borro este restaurante y no volveremos nunca, mal servicio mal ambiente y woe forma de pago."

delishbutdeafening,"Dined on September 16, 2021",5,"I’ve been eating at Casa Mono since it opened and am happy to report that the food, service, and wine list are better than ever.  There are old standbys — sweetbreads, razor clams, skirt steak — and many new dishes on the menu; each executed perfectly.  The only change I hate is the music which in a small, crowded, hard-surfaced space rise quickly to a level requiring one to shout to be heard.  Don’t people like to converse any more as well as eat!?"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 16, 2021",5,Table was a bit small for three people but otherwise great

lsfcmh,"Dined on September 1, 2021",3,"Business lunch completely ruined by restaurants construction. workmen deciding to do construction 10 feet away from where we were eating making it literally impossible to hear across the table.  Cannot comprehend  why they would do this in the midst of the lunchtime rush instead of before 12 or after 2. Complained to the waiter multiple times. Skirt steak, scallops, burrata were absolutely delicious. Pepper stuffed with short rib had almost no meat. Potatoes were so under cooked you could barely cut with a knife"
WarrenS,"Dined on September 1, 2021",2,"I asked for a table for 3. They gave me a very small table, appropriate for 2, even though I asked for one with more room. This is a tapas restaurant with lots of little plates. We spent the whole meal juggling plates. It just didn’t work. I liked this place last time, but this really soured me on the experience."
JarBoston,"Dined on August 31, 2021",3,This restaurant used to be much better. Looks like their success has lowered the standards for quality in both food and service.  It was also disappointing to see that kitchen staff and most waiters do not wear masks . They have one toilet that is not enough for the current capacity of guests and is not maintained well enough.    The highlight of the Menu used to be their razor clams but the last two times I visited they didnt have them...  If you cant get them dont leave them on the menu.....
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 30, 2021",4,"The food was good, but either food or service as expected for a 4 star Michelin."
JuminC,"Dined on August 28, 2021",5,The food is exceptional. I enjoyed the every dish I ordered.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 28, 2021",5,Love the razor clam
LaFleur,"Dined on August 26, 2021",5,Nice dinner in the streetery. Missed the razor clams though.
Jason,"Dined on August 26, 2021",4,"My experience there started off very rocky.  While we were about to be seated, a girl at the host stand came up to us and in a very stern voice said ""Just so you know, we need that table back at 7:30.""  What a horrible way to start of the experience.  We weren't a walk in either, we had a reservation for 5:45.  After we were seated everything got much better.  A great wait staff that knew the menu in and out (my wife is celiac).  The food was incredible, especially the goat confit.  The wine list is fantastic as well.  I will be back, but hopefully that hostess won't be working that day.  If not for her, my overall score would've been perfect."
Ernesto,"Dined on August 25, 2021",5,Service and food were amazing!!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 24, 2021",5,A birthday lunch. Everything we ordered was delicious.  Small tastings of so many delicious things.  We were 3 people and ordered 7 different plates.
Nancy,"Dined on August 24, 2021",5,I have been a long time customer of casa mono. love everything!
Drea,"Dined on August 23, 2021",5,"The food was absolutely amazing.  Each dish offered your palette a new tasting experience.  We will definitely be coming back to this restaurant.  It's a nice hidden gem on Irving.  My wife and I loved that tapas type vibe, and the music helped round out the entire evening.   Also, the wine selection was beautiful.  Highly recommend."
sparty,"Dined on August 22, 2021",5,"Absolutely amazing! Our favorite meal in NYC so far. The food, ambiance were perfect. We enjoyed fantastic wine and a wonderful evening out. Would return in a heartbeat"
MyMusings,"Dined on August 19, 2021",5,Simply one of the best meals I've had in NYC.
GeorgeK,"Dined on August 18, 2021",5,table next to us had 2 extremely Loud customers . This was a business Lunch not at night. You should really try to space out tables
AnaY,"Dined on August 18, 2021",5,"Loved the food.  Razor clams, Confit Goat, Pork Belly, Pan con tomate, Fideos with Chorizo, Scallops -- they were all great!  All three desserts were good but it seemed like the chocolate ganache was the favorite."
108NYC,"Dined on August 16, 2021",5,"My husband and I are serious cooks. We rarely go out to a restaurant -- but when we do we almost always go to Casa Mona. Consistently exceptional food and wine list, changing menu, small, intimate, casual. it always delivers excellence."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 16, 2021",4,Everything was great! The only issue was being initially seated between 2 large tables full of people. The hostess was able to accommodate another table by the door which was actually great as it gave us enough space to have a sense of privacy. The only other issue was the 90 min reservation limit is too tight. No one brought it up but we were there more like 2 hrs which included dessert!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 16, 2021",2,"Service was terrible. First of all, we could only order once as there was dining time limit of 1.15hr. The server, Axxxx, came to our table only 2 times - when we ordered and when we asked for a check. Never checked on us while the octopus we ordered was over-‘burnt’. And the other server came and we asked how come it is burnt so much, and he was like ‘so do you want it or no?’ What kind of attitude is that at a Michelin star restaurant? I was so disappointed Foods here in general are normal, nothing special. I had much better spanish foods from other restaurants without Michelin star."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 15, 2021",1,"The food was great but our main server, Angie, was the least friendly and helpful server we’ve ever met."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 14, 2021",5,"In a city such as New York City, where the food scene is ever-changing, the question “Which restaurants do you recommend or are your favorites?” can be so daunting. But Casa Mono is definitely one that stands out (in my humble opinion) and you should note, whether you are a local or visitor!  Don’t forget to order the Foie Gras, Bone Marrow, Sardines & Endive dishes!"
GabyK,"Dined on August 13, 2021",2,The food was Not great and our waiter was really bad and mean.
SomethingAbout,"Dined on August 13, 2021",5,"We had a great experience! We ate outdoors during the heatwave, so it as a bit hot, but that's the weather's fault, not the restaurant.  Every dish was excellent - flavorful profiles with surprising combinations that pleased the tastebuds. The sommelier was very knowledgable and recommended use a fantastic rose that I will be searching for again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 13, 2021",5,"consistent, delicious, well staffed, great presentation, creative menu. wines from everywhere. cool area!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 11, 2021",5,"Juan Pablo, nos explico todo y siempre atento"
Benjamin,"Dined on August 11, 2021",4,"The waitress was very dismissive when we told her we were just going to have drinks and order a few bites. Apparently they have a sister bar for rif raf like us and we were moved around the corner to a whole different establishment to sit inside even though we reserved an outside table. It was very rude service for something that is not explained on their reservation site.  We had a great time at their sister bar, but being made to shamefully pickup our stuff and move? That set the tone and we won’t be returning."
MESBrklyn,"Dined on August 10, 2021",4,Tasty Restaurant week lunch! I can't wait to try dinner
Helen,"Dined on August 10, 2021",5,The service was fantastic! Foie gras is a must!!!!
WLBayRidge,"Dined on August 8, 2021",5,"Professional from start to finish. Great, well thought through and executed food. (We first went there shortly after it opened 17 years ago. Loved it then. Impressed with it now.)"
DanR,"Dined on August 7, 2021",5,"This is a fantastic place for an inventive take on tapas. Each dish was unique and exquisite. The pulpo with fennel and grapefruit, and the pork belly were highlights. But everything was great. It’s a bit pricey, but well worth it. We’ll be back!"
Fulen,"Dined on August 7, 2021",3,"Food was very good but table was too tiny to fit food and noise was overwhelming, even outside."
Spinsrod,"Dined on August 7, 2021",5,"Excellent food, service and ambiance!! Never ever disappoints"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 5, 2021",5,Such wonderful choices for food and unbelievable wine list. The staff always treats you right
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 2, 2021",5,Tastes good but overpriced
Balserbaby,"Dined on August 1, 2021",4,"I have been going to Casa Mono for a long time, and this time the food was not quite as good as usual: overcooked razor clams, and sweetbreads so coated with breading and nuts that the sweetbreads themselves were not tastable.  Very good wine, and soft scrambled eggs and bread and olives...."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 1, 2021",5,Insanely good tapas. Specialty iberico jamon is a must
andrewm,"Dined on July 28, 2021",5,"The restaurant week menu had no selection just a fixed appetizer and entree.  Both were perfect, the salad was very crisp and the manchego cheese added to the flavor, the entree was grilled dorada fish which was perfectly cooked with crispy skin.  A very enjoyable meal."
T9Fu,"Dined on July 28, 2021",5,"What else could be said, outstanding in every way, and we really enjoyed the seafood offering for restaurant week!"
MicheleR,"Dined on July 28, 2021",5,"The food set off an explosion of amazing flavors and textures in my mouth...and my nose caught wave after wave of intoxicating aromas.  The people engaged us with smiles that said, ""I really care.""  After being unable to see each other during the pandemic, we celebrated Italy's opening its borders and New York opening its streets. Next?  My friend from Morocco."
LeighH,"Dined on July 28, 2021",2,"Arrived at 4:45 for 5:15PM reservation. Empty restaurant. Told we could not be seated until our 5:15 reservation. Requested indoor seating when finally allowed to sit at 5:15 (still 80% empty in restaurant). Was told, ""you need to give table back by 6:15."" We sat at 5:15, server didn't come over to take orders until 5:30, drinks weren't poured until 5:40, first course arrived at 6:15, second arrived at 6:30. They didn't take the table back at 6:15, but rudeness of host and stress created by timing was extremely unpleasant - especially when service was inattentive/slow throughout dinner. Shame - this place used to be phenomenal. Hope they retrain/improve host and wait staff to provide an experience that is as high-caliber as the food they serve."
Alex,"Dined on July 28, 2021",3,"Service was non-existent, I would have ordered more drinks but I only saw my waitress once."
GabrielK,"Dined on July 27, 2021",5,definitely a must visit place if you're a fan of tapas/spanish cuisine
ChrisI,"Dined on July 25, 2021",5,As always great food and service from one of our favourite restaurants in NYC.
Xavi,"Dined on July 24, 2021",4,First time since Covid  The food was amazing and full of flavor. The sweetbreads tasted better than I recall. The only thing I wish they still had on their menu are the razor clams.
Foodie,"Dined on July 23, 2021",5,"The food, the service, the ambiance were superb. Definitely making this place my go to for tapas"
ChrisE,"Dined on July 23, 2021",5,This place was truly outstanding. Spanish tapas meets Michelin star quality. A winning combination.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 23, 2021",5,The food is really amazing !
Partricia0915,"Dined on July 22, 2021",5,All small dishes are delicious and We can enjoy with wines.  I like to watch open kitchen and always fresh foods are served.  I think they are always busy but not overwhelming services. I can be relaxing and enjoying to dine.
Cesarp,"Dined on July 22, 2021",5,In one word ‘extraordinary’ ! Best Spanish restaurant in NY!
SabenaS,"Dined on July 21, 2021",5,Three of us enjoyed the Restaurant Week lunch even though the menu was limited. Two of us had eaten here a few rimes when the restaurant first opened and we continued to enjoy the food. The service was ez relent.
KatrinaG,"Dined on July 21, 2021",1,The service attitude is very bad!!! Will never go to again!
MSMiya,"Dined on July 21, 2021",5,"Our server, Antonio was very courteous and helpful for the choice of foods and wines. It was a little disappointing that on the day they did not have razor-clam and sardine that we wanted to try for sure. As for the noise level, it was too much in the beginning since a workman was sawing some panels and pillars right next to us.  Even thought it lasted only a short while, it was disturbing enough.  Could they not have done that king of work while guests were not present?  Otherwise, foods and services were very good and we would like to come back for another dishes and wines."
MJC123,"Dined on July 20, 2021",4,Outdoor seating on a beautiful summer’s day.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 20, 2021",3,Food is good. Service is not good.
jessicas,"Dined on July 20, 2021",5,"it was so good, the waiter was so good, there was a point when the music turned on and it got a little loud. My friend and I sat outside and the weather was perfect."
DanW,"Dined on July 19, 2021",4,"Outstanding food; not much for Vegans/Vegetarians. Service is perhaps ""European style""...seated at table, waited 10 minutes for menus, and another 10 for wait staff to come over. Very loud. If you're a cheese fan, order on the light side...there's a great-looking cheese plate on the dessert menu that I was too full to attempt."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 18, 2021",5,We loved this restaurant. Very interesting menu. Shared 8 dishes and really loved them all. Particularly  the Dorado and the sardines w endive and the goat…
elsita,"Dined on July 18, 2021",4,"We went there mostly for the Jamón Ibérico we have seen on their website but it wasn't on the menu, which was a bummer. Besides that, the food was nice, especially the razor clams which were delicious. It was a bit pricey too, but I will probably go back eventually as I enjoyed it all in all."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 17, 2021",5,AMAZING experience
CelticTiger,"Dined on July 16, 2021",5,"Great food at a very acceptable price. All dishes were very tasty, and I look forward to returning and trying others."

DavidR,"Dined on July 16, 2021",5,Simply outstanding. Great attention to detail. Every plate well executed. Pork belly amazing.
Saverin,"Dined on July 15, 2021",4,"A nice place, where I've always been a bit surprised that the food is as good as it is. Today was no exception.  All our food was extremely tasty. The portions were extremely small meagre. though we all are small eaters. Make sure you order a starter, in addition to dessert(we ordered it) or you'll certainly need to eat when you get home  Service was quite pleasant, though one jarring note: At home, I checked before coming your wine list.  It said that Valdespino Innocente was #13 for 375 ml.,  Waitress brought a small glass.  Told her menu said 375 ml.  She brought the half bottle, but when we got the bill, I was charged @35. Complaining about this sizable difference, I was shown the menu, which in the restaurant said$13/$35. I paid, though most unhappily; a real downer to an otherwise pleasant meal Website should be corrected, at the very least."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 15, 2021",5,"Food was delicious, the hospitality shown was superb. A must go."

ChrisN,"Dined on July 11, 2021",5,Wow.  Just wow.  Best meal we’ve had in years.  Excellent service.  The pacing of the servings was perfect.   Recommend highly
FGS1201,"Dined on July 10, 2021",5,"Consistently good, though the menu has shrunk a little."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 8, 2021",5,"We went for lunch and being a Michelin star restaurant, we were excited for the experience and offerings.  Everything met our expectations and then some.  The razor clams were amazing in the garlic sauce, so tender and tasty.  The skirt steak over the romesco with the onions was so delicious.  The pork belly was made perfectly with the right amount of crisp and flavor.  The Burrata and mushrooms complemented each other.  The patatas bravas were a nice twist to the traditional dish. Finally the crema catalana was just enough, perfect consistency and the bay leaf buñuelos were the finishing touch.   Would definitely go back — was worth the price point for the offerings, size of the tapas and overall composition and experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 7, 2021",5,It was a good experience with friends :)
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 6, 2021",4,Very good food. Especially burrata.
Kathy,"Dined on July 6, 2021",2,"Been going for years and always an exceptional experience . Y’day, however,  was sub par and disappointing .  The entire staff seemed miserable and boy interested in being there . This from the onset, the host who was unwelcoming at best . Several items were not available despite being on the menu. For an already limited menu this doesn’t make for much choice .  Not in a hurry to go back."

CaitB,"Dined on July 2, 2021",5,"Food was excellent and the servers couldn’t have been nicer. From descriptions to recommendations they were super helpful and attentive but did not overdo it. Really great experience!  We had the Paranya’s bravas, lamb, croquettes, fideos, and sardines for dinner and the crema catalana for dessert. Fried bay leaves were incredible!"
BrendaSR,"Dined on July 1, 2021",5,Bring back the Tortillas!!
JenniferN,"Dined on June 30, 2021",5,"Warm, professional service. They've done a beautiful job with their indoor and outdoor spaces, and on a steamy summer night nothing is better than a glass of Txakolina followed by the sea scallops in green curry."
MayL,"Dined on June 29, 2021",4,Would have given a higher rating but the lack of air-conditionning indoors made this the hottest meal we have ever endured!
lkern31,"Dined on June 28, 2021",5,"We had a wonderful meal at Casa Mono. 6 dishes was perfect for us (2 people). We didn't care for the fingerling potatoes (very smoky flavor, but if you like that you'd love them), but absolutely do not pass on the scallops!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 24, 2021",5,"If you want very good versions of many of the classic tapas served in Madrid, this is your place.  Yes, it is not inexpensive, but the service and food are worth it.  My only complaint was the patatas bravas, different sauce and not spicy. I rec. to pass. Great wine selection with many choices at each price range. Don't skip the crema Catalan."
Elemich,"Dined on June 24, 2021",5,Delicious food. Service was pleasant but a little slow. Perfect for a late lunch.
Brklyn,"Dined on June 23, 2021",3,The low rating is due to the restaurant did not have two of their signature dishes: they were out of the bone marrow and the razor clams. Those are the reasons I made my reservations. From now on I will have to call before hand to see if they are serving these two dishes. The rest of the menu is just ok.
MarianaK,"Dined on June 22, 2021",4,Excellent food but really pricey for small portions.

VillageDiner,"Dined on June 17, 2021",4,"This was our first visit to Casa Mono, an unassuming restaurant on the quiet blocks south of Gramercy Park. The interior of the restaurant is small and cramped, but we ate on the somewhat larger sidewalk patio. Our table for 3 was no larger than a bicycle wheel, and since it is a tapas place there was some juggling needed to fit all the plates. We had 7 dishes, just about right for a big lunch. We had the bacaloa, goat confit, pimientos, skirt steak, pulpo, manchego salad and sobrasada. All were very tasty and very distinctive. The quality of the food was actually remarkable for such a small place. Service was friendly but a little slow, so plan on a leisurely meal in the Spanish tradition. At about $70/pp, taxes tip and wine included, Casa Mono is no bargain, but the quality of the food justifies the price. We expect to return."
Nancy,"Dined on June 16, 2021",5,Excellent food and service in spite of noise from the construction 🚧
Souschef,"Dined on June 15, 2021",5,I love the whole vibe of Casa Mono.  Food is excellent as well as service.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 3, 2021",2,"I have been to Casa Mono before. However, my experience yesterday was disappointing. The portion of the food was too minimalist and the flavor wasn’t the best. I felt that ever dish was too expensive for the price and size of the portion."

KevinT,"Dined on May 31, 2021",2,"We have always loved Casa Mono since we started going a few years back.  During the pandemic, we've been back several times.  This last time was by far the worst time and wondering the need to go back.  Items like the tomato bread coming with maybe one or two chunks of tomato (but mostly oil) or being told we ordered one serving of something when we ordered two.  Empty dirty dishes sat on the table waiting to be cleared and weren't removed until after the next plates came.  We never saw the waitress so when we had to ask the hostess for something, she seemed insulted.  Water was never filled and only one glass of wine for two of our friends - when they never were asked for a second, they just went without anything - our water was empty by then. The server was so nondescript in her approach and lacked any sense of what was going on.  Not impressed."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 30, 2021",5,Great food and service!!!!!!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 29, 2021",2,"The food was overall okay, somewhat lacking in flavor. Our waiters were really attentive and made the experience better. Outdoor dining was a bit of a mess with the rain and wind, there was a bit of accident but we were accommodated after which was really kind. I did ask for a birthday desert acknowledgement towards the end and it may have been forgotten but that was only  really disappointing part of the night."

Foodiefamily,"Dined on May 14, 2021",5,Food was delicious. The portions were larger than expected. Our server was gracious and knowledgeable- she helped us with wine choices and her descriptions were right on target. It was a lovely meal.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 11, 2021",5,Amazing! Fabulous food and staff
Ernesto,"Dined on May 10, 2021",5,"Literally the best tapas in the city and has been their entire existence. Every menu item is delicious, the wine selection is fantastic, service is very attentive. Just go there."
Artchick,"Dined on May 9, 2021",5,"The food at Casa Mono does not miss a beat. It is complex in flavor and utterly delicious, one dish more than the next.  We had not been to Casa Mono in years and were thrilled to find it still has that ""magic"" despite taking a few old favorites off the menu.  We look forward to returning very soon."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 9, 2021",5,I took my girlfriend here for her bday and it was the best tapas I’ve ever had . We ordered about 5 tapas between us both and it was enough . The wine was amazing and our waiter Jahdea made the experience even better !
Mudlark,"Dined on May 9, 2021",4,"I love this place. The food is so yummy. I mean, next level yummy. It's so cozy and gorgeous and fun. And the servers are so sweet, nice and have great suggestions.  I can't quite give it a full 5 stars however because there were three mistakes with our order, and that's just too many. First they forgot to bring the starter of pan con tomate. Then, I saw a server dropping off our food-- or trying to-- at another table. I tried to tell him that was our order, but he refused to believe me. The table sent one item back-- i guess they didn't want the fish-- but kept the side vegetable of greens! Yep. Then a little later, the server returned with the rejected fish (somewhat cold now), and I tried again to say ""and those are our greens over there too"" but again, he didn't seem to believe me. It was sorted out eventually-- long after the fish was consumed-- it's just, I kind of like to eat my sides, as a side... next to the main. And so by the time my tea with dessert was also forgotten about, I was definitely feeling a bit 'ignored.' All in all, tho the food is amazing... just be aware the service might be a bit spotty."
WilliamF,"Dined on May 8, 2021",5,Wonderful dinner.

Chloe,"Dined on May 7, 2021",4,"The doors were wide open the entire time. As a result, we were freezing while having dinner and couldn’t enjoy it. Food was good but a bit too oily for us. Service was good. Manager was awesome. Overall, it wasn’t what we expected"
susanjo,"Dined on May 7, 2021",5,Casa Mono is a wonderful restaurant! Loved it pre-pandemic and Thursday was the first time I've been back and it was great. Sharing interesting small plates is my favorite way to dine and these dishes are perfect. The wine list is outstanding - if a bit pricey. The indoor dining is limited due to the small space so we were outdoors - less than wonderful but given the circumstances I could not complain! Happy to be back
JaimeF,"Dined on May 3, 2021",5,"Honestly it's amazing. Staff, service, food, wine, everything. I love coming here as often as I can."
EastEndEats,"Dined on April 29, 2021",5,"I can say without hesitation that this restaurant was among the best tapas restaurants I have ever been to. That includes not only New York, but Madrid, Mexico, and in Bilbao. It is sensational. Don’t pass this one up."
ErichW,"Dined on April 29, 2021",5,All food of high quality and most dishes are quite unique.  Wine list is amazing.
NatalieG,"Dined on April 28, 2021",4,Food was delicious but they were very understaffed - we had to flag down busboys to find our waitress for us
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 27, 2021",4,The food was outstanding. The seating situation could have been better the chairs were not comfortable and the table felt like it was tilted sideways. But the wine the Sommelier recommended was delicious. I will definitely be coming back.
DmitryP,"Dined on April 26, 2021",5,"Thank You, was a great experience! We really enjoyed the food."
NancyJ,"Dined on April 25, 2021",5,"I always lived this place when I lived in NYC. So glad I was able to go back and bring friends. The food is still as good and the stuff are amazing, true New Yorker speed and service!"
NertilaC,"Dined on April 24, 2021",3,"I was looking forward to try the tapas at Casa Mono. The food was very good, but the service and ambiance was poor. We had the reservation outdoors and we seated almost at the entrance of the restaurant's door. The restaurant has a light wooden construction with some windows to open. Our table was like in a corridor and the draft  even the wind that day was blowing from everywhere. We asked our waiter if they could closed the windows or do smth bcs even though outside was like 70 degree, its was blowing and cold at our table. she said she was not allowed to do that, while we were freezing. We asked and managed to get indoor the restaurant and from there they forgot us. Waiters never checked on us, just dropped the food and anytime we had to ask for water or menu desert we had to wait a long time before they would come to us. Food is delicious but they really have to do smth with the service and ambience."
KristinaC,"Dined on April 24, 2021",5,I had an amazing time as always! Darwin was very attentive and provided perfect service. I would definitely go back again.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 18, 2021",2,"Terrible service. They forgot about us multiple times because we were in the corner. The server placed knives with the sharp end sticking out toward my bf, off the table which we thought was a very weird thing to do. The music was very loud. The food was okay, dessert was great and may have saved the night."

Timelessgrace,"Dined on April 11, 2021",5,The staff was professional and personable. The food was awesome as usual. I particularly enjoyed the foie gras and lamb belly entrees today.

MaggieW,"Dined on April 10, 2021",1,The wine list was great but the menu was limited and everything was overly sauced and seasoned.  The chef refused to make any modifications to meet my needs.

Douglas,"Dined on April 2, 2021",5,"First indoor restaurant dining since March 2020 after 2 vaccinations. Always a favorite. Food is delicious and creative. Nice variety of choices and menu is intelligently curated. Deep, deep Spanish wine cellar. Super friendly helpful staff. THE go-to place for tapas in NYC. Prices are not cheap, so it’s not a “deal”, but fair value for the excellent food."
RachelM,"Dined on April 2, 2021",5,"This place never disappoints!  The food is beyond amazing.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable of all aspects of the restaurant.  I can't wait for my next trip to Casa Mono!  Oh, and get the Fideos w/chorizo and the Skirt Steak and the Goat!"
MacA,"Dined on April 1, 2021",5,Awesome food and awesome service! The goat confit was my favorite by far!
NathalieS,"Dined on March 31, 2021",5,"Fun place , food is alway consistent and really good."
JaneF,"Dined on March 31, 2021",4,"If you eat there they give you an 1.45 hour to eat.  They rush you the whole time.  Instead of bringing the plates out one at a time as we asked, they brought it out all at once.  Therefore the food got cold.  Then they rush you to clear away the plates one by one, then they start walking around the table to move you along.  This was all done within the first hour.  Needless to say it was not enjoyable.  We have been to many restaurants with the same rules, but here they were rude and pushy."
Sarah,"Dined on March 31, 2021",5,"Juan was super amazing! Every table touch and every conversation with each staff member made my dining experience with my mom, who was visiting out of town, so happy! It’s always comforting going to places that are industry standards to impress non-industry folks! Thank you to everyone again, and hope to have another chance to come in!"
KyleL,"Dined on March 28, 2021",4,"Food is delicious as always. Pity that the razor shells are sold out by Sunday, but the dishes we ordered were all very good. You can basically bind order from the menu and everything will be delicious."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 26, 2021",5,"Amazing outdoor set up, great service, impeccable food"
Gloria,"Dined on March 26, 2021",2,"The food was not very good...unfortunately it was not very representative of true Spanish tapas from Spain...it was very Americanized and everything had too much sauce.  Also, they had no sangria...how could there be no sangria? Sangria is everywhere in Spain!"
Foodie,"Dined on March 25, 2021",4,Service was slow but suspect restaurant wasn't fully staffed as 50% dining had just come into effect.  Food was excellent and lovely outdoor dining.
Sportsgirl,"Dined on March 25, 2021",5,Excellent tapas and service.  Comfortable outdoor seating.
PBfoodie,"Dined on March 25, 2021",5,Always exceptional! The food and service are superb. Only improvement would be the host who in no way represents this glorious establishment. He needs training.
KatNDSpain,"Dined on March 21, 2021",5,"Everything was delicious. It was an outstanding experience. We loved every single dish. The outdoor setup was lovely and also pandemic-safe. Probably my favorites were the duck eggs with mojama tuna and truffles, and the razor clams a la plancha."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 20, 2021",5,Lunch outside - awesome as inside.
alisonb,"Dined on March 20, 2021",2,"The menu is interesting - fairly authentically Spanish (pulpo, setas, razor clams, croquetas) - typical of the fare you'd find at a beachside chiringuito in Spain - the disconnect between the style of food and the high pricing is considerable - Spanish food of this sort is meant to be casual, affordable, accessible. The croquetas werent great - the  cheese arrived too cold, and $40 for a modest plate of jamon iberico is nuts. Nothing exceptional to warrant a return visit."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 14, 2021",4,Tasty but overpriced
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 14, 2021",5,"Every dish is a work of art. Incredible food, and good value considering a Michelin Starred restaurant!"
Priya,"Dined on March 14, 2021",3,"The staff are so friendly, attentive, and wonderful! Ambiance was just right. While the wine is absolutely incredible, will say the food was extremely disappointing. Very over salted and over cooked.

Rocketmannequin,"Dined on March 6, 2021",5,"You have to hand it to Casa Mono.  We spend many summers in Spain, but when home in Manhattan this is where you can indulge in authentic, consistent but evolving and creative Spanish cuisine paired with knowledgeable and professional service.  But please don't go; I need to make sure that there's always a table available for me."
Gaurpru,"Dined on March 4, 2021",1,"We arrived at the restaurant at 7:55, had to wait for our table for 10 mins, fine. The table was next door at Bar Jamon, I told them I’ve already been to bar Jamon and i would like to sit at Casa mono. They said that would be a 20 min wait. So we sat at bar Jamon. The table we were given was right in the middle of the servers walk way, there was no social distancing or partition between out table and the table behind us. On our way out, we saw that there was an open table at Casa Mono. They didn’t want to give that to us. Then the reported us to opentable as a no show. We did show up, we got the worst table in the house and did not feel safe. I have reported them to 311. Almost ruined my birthday, but this is NYC, so we had an amazing restaurant down the street with no reservation. Will never go back. This place doesn’t care about their customer’s safety at all."
Aceguy10,"Dined on March 4, 2021",5,Food was interesting and of high quality.  There selection of Spanish wine is second to none.

JessicaW,"Dined on February 16, 2021",5,"So delicious still. Got an indoor counter seat. It was actually located in the Bar Jamon part of the restaurant. The doors were left open so the cold air did creep in, and after a few drinks I needed my coat indoors. Service was super outgoing and made wonderful recommendations for food and drinks."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 15, 2021",5,Amazing food with incredibly helpful staff. They were very accommodating with a gluten allergy and made us feel safe in everything we ate. Definitely pricey but it is worth it.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 14, 2021",5,Absolutely fantastic food and experience.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 7, 2021",5,"I’d give it a 5 star review all the way but for the $$$$. This is one of those places where you cannot arrive hungry bc it’s tapas. Yet each tapas dish is anywhere from 15-28$. We shared three tapas amongst two people and it was good we weren’t super hungry. Aside from the expense the food is next level delectable. Like work of art. We had (photos attached) the pulpo, duck egg and goat confit. Each bite was like a slice of heaven. Service is super attentive and friendly. The ambience is so-so bc their outdoor structures (built for street dining for pandemic ban on indoor eating) are dark and dingy so it’s very wintertime feeling right now but they do have individual heaters for each table. I’d go here again (if someone else is buying) or to celebrate special occasions as I can’t justify the expense! If that’s not a big deal for you , then I’d say go again and again and try everything on the menu. I bet you they don’t have a single “ordinary” dish. The menu is simply extra ordinary!!"

Olivia,"Dined on January 14, 2021",3,"The food was good but not great or worth going out of your way for especially for the price. The waiter was great and nice outdoor set up during covid, was warm enough to take off my jacket on a cold night in mid January."

rano,"Dined on December 6, 2020",4,We had eaten here about 2 months ago and the food was well seasoned. This time it was very salty as though the chef wasn’t confident in their cooking. The service was very good as was the wine. All and all disappointing.
JenniferH,"Dined on November 30, 2020",2,"Have been to restaurant a couple of times and always thought it was great.  Such a disappointment last Sunday evening.   Host was rude , just pointed to a table.  Took 2o minutes for a server to come (was joking with my friend that we should just leave.) Service was very slow.  Food was just BAD.  Stale bread. Too much garlic in everything.  Waiter could not produce a steak knife for the steak. Maybe things were off because it was a Sunday - but really no excuse."

GrantM,"Dined on November 15, 2020",5,"Simple flavor profiles and ingredients done in a masterful, upscale way.  The outdoor seating was a notch above the other attempts to accommodate pandemic dining in the street."
Reza,"Dined on November 10, 2020",1,"There was an abnormal amount of hostility from the staff as soon as I came. I know that there is an pandemic ongoing, but none of the hundreds of restaurants I had been during the 2020 pandemic in New York and 11 other cities in America, Europe, and Middle East have treated me with such hostility. It appears to be their policy. I was at an outdoor table, and waiters would refuse to approach my table unless I put a facemask on, while I'm sitting at the table. They made me feel like a leper and a criminal. It's a restaurant, not a hospital ward. Don't give these people any more money. Go to other places."

KristinaC,"Dined on November 7, 2020",5,It was great dining at Casa Mono. On Irving it’s relatively quiet so not much noise from the cars. Tony was our server and was very knowledgeable about the menu. He gave us great suggestions and I would recommend going back based on that. He was able to adapt to my tight schedule and got me out on time so I was able to stay on time for the rest of the day.

fglick,"Dined on October 14, 2020",4,"The food was excellent but we had some strange service at the beginning. First they didn’t want to sit us at a table far away from everyone though the place was rather empty. Then they changed their minds. My friend ordered a glass of rose and I couldn’t decide between 2 cavas and the waiter wouldn’t give me a taste of both! I have never heard of that. I said to him finally, bring her a taste and me a taste. After that, we were ignored for a very long time. Finally the waiter came to take our order and was actually very nice so I’m not sure what the story was. The place is pricey and there is no reason to be treated that way."

SamuelB,"Dined on October 11, 2020",5,"Excellent. All around, excellent. For a good and special meal, Casa Mono never disappoints!  A minor criticism: we made a table request for our anniversary that was not honored. The place we ended up sitting was arguably better than the requested spot but still, something to note."

MarkD,"Dined on September 20, 2020",5,"I feel that I needed to write this in response to a review posted on 11/09/20.  I felt the review was unfair to the waitstaff, so I wanted to share our experience.   If, as she claims, she has been to “hundreds of restaurants” in “…New York and 11 other cities in America, Europe and the Middle East” during the pandemic is true, then I think it is entirely appropriate that the waitstaff, or anyone else for that matter, ask her to put her mask on.  Her dining out at hundreds of restaurants in 12 cities across the globe during the months of the pandemic places all at risk. If--what she says is the truth…  Hundreds of restaurants— in 12 cities— on different continents— during the pandemic— would be quite a feat.  We have dined outside at Casa Mono 3 times during the pandemic. At no time did any server ask us to put our masks back on before they would approach the table to serve, replace silverware or pour water. We kept our masks on when initially ordering, but then had them off through most of the meal, although we try and put them on when we know someone is approaching the table, but sometimes we are not that fast.  The servers here are dedicated professionals and we would hate to see a negative review such as this affect their business. Given the number of positive reviews, I doubt it will.  Contrary to her advice, we will continue to give this restaurant and the staff our “money”.  In fact, her “review” has prompted us to make our next reservation."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 19, 2020",4,The steak are so delicious👍🏻
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 13, 2020",5,Razor clams were a highlight
michaelm,"Dined on September 13, 2020",5,The ONLY drawback was the slightly too dark outdoor dining due to the covid-19 pandemic. But this was restaurant was on my desired go-to list for a longtime and my only regret was that I hadn’t gone years ago. Phenomenal food! Keep in mind however that the dishes are tapas so they are small.

AngeL,"Dined on August 24, 2020",3,"Food is decent. Unfortunately pricing has increased over the years. Tables outside could use some love, given that patrons will be dining outside for the foreseeable future, per covid protocols."

EllenP,"Dined on August 18, 2020",5,Eating outside at CasaMona is dream come true.  You must get the Burrata - it is out of this world.   A bit of Serrano ham and a bit of jam with the yummiest of tomatoes with the creamiest of Burrata.    Everything on the menu has a combination of flavors that make it complete unique.  There is no place like it.
Ilovegoodfood,"Dined on August 18, 2020",4,Solid restaurant. Reliable. Well flavored food.
BrianB,"Dined on August 16, 2020",5,So happy casa mono is open.  Favorite spot in nyc.  Was craving the oxtail for months.
MadisonL,"Dined on August 15, 2020",4,"Scallops, buratta, and octopus were excellent.   Duck was very greasy and the avocado was underripe - the dish was not very tasty. The croquetas were average.   Service was very friendly. Extremely limited non alcoholic drink options."

MisterStars,"Dined on July 5, 2020",5,We had a wonderful dinner at Casa Mono. Their outdoor seating just makes it even more special to be there. Looking forward to going back.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 2, 2020",5,"Food was absolutely fantastic. Burrata and figs was the winner; with the scallops coming in second (it was perfectly seared). There was some construction on the street that was very noisy but can’t help it. Great service, great food, I can see why they received a Michelin Star. Well deserved."
Sara,"Dined on June 29, 2020",5,"They had just re-opened after being shut down because of the COVID crisis quarantine and their only option was outdoor dining. The streets were closed off for the tables to be set outside and the staff were more than accommodating when it started to rain. They moved us to a more covered table and brought all the furniture inside while it poured on them! Their fantastic service was still not disrupted and the wine and food were amazing! Definitely a memorable visit but would 100% go back again and again for their pork sopressata .. or however you spell it! Either way, it was amazing."
lvillanueva,"Dined on March 9, 2020",5,Food was awesome! Everything was great! Definitely a must!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 6, 2020",1,"We arrived about 20 min early for our reservation and the host said our table was not yet ready. Understandably, we asked if we could have a drink at the bar and he said unfortunately those seats are reserved for people that are coming. So we said, ok we’ll go to the bar next door and come back. He quickly replied unfortunately Bar Jamon is closed for a private party. I didn’t even know the bar around the corner belonged to the same chain. So I said, ok what do you suggest we do then? I mean, it isNYC and I assumed there was more than one bar to go to. He said there’s a bar across the street, and then he said, oh wait. The private event is done at Bar Jamon. You can go there. We didn’t. We went across the street and were texted by an unknown number at 8:21pm, “your seats are ready. Please come to the host within 10 minutes of receiving this message.” Then I received a phone call from a different number at 8:27Pm from the same rude host telling us our table was ready and if we were on our way. We were literally right across the street. We went over at 8:30 exactly. They offered to take my coat while dealing with another couple at their entrance. He pointed to our seats and said you’re over there in the corner. We were not sat or directed with menus. He took my coat but not my brothers and I had to hand him my coat and go around the couple the we’re trying to assist. Our waiter did not introduce himself or make a connection or even discuss the menu. I don’t even know how he would have given the tight space we were in. The only thing I can say is the food was delicious. Of course on exiting the same host from early merely said, how did you like everything. I mean my brother is only in town for three nights and I used up one of them on this AWFUL HORRIBLE service. Michelin star? Maybe once upon a time. If the host hadn’t been so abrupt and rude on our arrival, I may have had a different opinion but the server did nothing above and beyond to change my mind."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 4, 2020",2,The waiter was very rude and impatient. He seemed like he hated his job…
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 2, 2020",5,Great!! It was excelente in every category

KaranG,"Dined on February 14, 2020",4,Been going here for years. Food is good but I remember it being better. Still a solid spot.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 12, 2020",4,"We had a pretty good experience. Some plates were great, others were off. Service was attentive and cordial but not as professional as I expected.  The kitchen's counter was not comfortable enough. That is a major difference with Mercado at Little Spain. Also the chef was not too shy and reclusive."
AlexZ,"Dined on February 11, 2020",5,"Casa Mono is probably, subjectively, my favorite restaurant in Manhattan; it is a pity I cannot afford to dine here every night.  For tapas, it simply can't be beat."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 6, 2020",4,"Ambiance and service was nice. Restaurant week meal was okay, not amazing."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 6, 2020",2,"Went for restaurant week. The croquet had a very long fish bone in it. From presentation to taste and texture, I cannot they got Michelin star. None of the dishes were necessarily good. I do not understand the high rating here and feel very disappointed."
DavidA,"Dined on February 2, 2020",2,"I am not a master chef nor am I a world renowned chef, however, I still have a great love, appreciation and admiration for food and fine dining.  To me and many others, Michelin star ratings are very hard to come by and with that certain standards and quality are supposed to follow.  Unfortunately, to start with, the service was non existent and absolutely no recommendations or suggestions were given.  I was simply told let me know if you need something, 15 minutes later asks me ""you ready"".  The bread, which was an appetizer of sorts came out very cold.  In addition to that the plates were substandard and I just simply felt none of the dishes were made with love."

BrendanM,"Dined on January 30, 2020",5,Amazing restaurant. Couldn’t be happier with the food as well as the server’s attention to detail and ability to recommend delicious small plates and wine
NoMadFAN,"Dined on January 29, 2020",5,"Have not been here in a couple years and it has not lost its quality in any respect. Still some of the best Spanish food in the city and the staff is great. We shared the Bacalao croquetas w/orange aioli, Sardinas Fritas, Scallops w/Curry & Cashew, Duck Egg with Mojama, and the Duck Breast - If that all sounds flavorful - it is! all great combos, super tasty - along with a lovely Basque White (txakoli). very enjoyable evening!"
SamS,"Dined on January 20, 2020",5,Spectacularly wonderful lunch well beyond expectations. Every dish was exceptionally flavorful and satisfying. I can’t wait to return. Deserves 10 stars!!  The Michelin rating is spot on!
BrianB,"Dined on January 20, 2020",5,"My favorite spot in nyc.  Outstanding menu executed perfectly.  Sit at bar to watch it get prepared.  Real professionals with real creativity not seen in so many restaurants.  Also, great pairings."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 20, 2020",5,"Great food!We ordered the razor clam, skirt steak,goat with avocado,creamy eggs and also foie gras.That was a little bit too much for two of us. Foir gras&skirt steak was amazing.Creamy eggs tasted really special with nuts and lemon."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 17, 2020",3,"Service is fine, food is underwhelming and environment is awful. For the price point they charge consider the other great Spanish restaurants instead to enjoy!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 1, 2020",5,This place is always amazing.   Even for that super early New Year’s Eve  dinner experience when civilized New Yorkers want to eat and get home because they wouldn’t be caught dead anywhere near Times Square late.   That being said Casa Mono is one of my favorites and I highly suggest sitting at the bar near the kitchen.   There is no other place for a foodie to sit and get the full experience.   Watching the line prepare your order is a thrill.   I always get the bone marrow here.  It’s superbly done and served with toast points that would pull anyone off a no carb diet.  The duck breast is always meaty and moist.  Grilled to perfection and served with a complement of perfectly pared flavor of items you’ll never want duck from anywhere else.   The wine and cocktail menu match the food menu with a sublime selection that goes with everything.  I always go with their recommendation and have never been disappointed.   Thanks again
Robman15,"Dined on December 28, 2019",3,been coming for years.  felt like going through motions. food was just ok. sweetbreads overly battered.  other just ok.  spent a lot on top wine and asked for a half serving of something and not accommodating.  bummer as this has always been a favorite but maybe just offnight

MaryT,"Dined on November 16, 2019",3,"Great food but horrible service. It was 15 minutes before we got even a glass of water!!  We ordered wine which took another 15 minutes to appear. Even with a reservation we were seated at the worst table in the restaurant -- tucked against a wall of wine bottles -- and we insisted that we move.  The food at Casa Mono is truly wonderful but they've squeezed in far too many tables for the space and the service staff is overwhelmed! IF we were to return, we'd sit at the bar where the staff seemed more attentive."
Monty26,"Dined on October 29, 2019",5,love this restaurant! dream of the razor clams! would go back in an instant!

OctDiner,"Dined on October 15, 2019",5,"Wonderful food and great wines. A little cramped - we didn’t realize how tiny the place was, but we managed. The food made it totally worth it. Would definitely return."
1TP1,"Dined on October 7, 2019",5,"Consistently magnificent flavors, spectacularly deep wine list and expert service.  A bit less consistent is service, which ranges from terrific to somewhat inattentive.  Our sommelier seemed to be doing the heavy lifting for most aspects of our meal, which may have allowed our primary server to neglect replenishing our water.  A minor criticism of an overall wonderful experience with vibrant flavors and cheerful staff."
pk41,"Dined on September 17, 2019",5,"All was excellent: food and services, only the music was a bit too loud when we almost finished around 7pm."
Abez,"Dined on September 10, 2019",2,Food turned out not to be that good.  The service was very slow between plates.  Some dishes had to be sent back twice to cook more.
Foodie,"Dined on September 8, 2019",5,We came to enjoy a trip past memory lane fro our vacation to Madrid.  With an extensive Spanish wine list and the traditional dishes offered we were able to reminisce in the way we had hoped. We will be back!
SJOBklyn,"Dined on September 8, 2019",3,"We were crammed into a table so close to the window only our skinny kids could sit in those seats. The room is small, busy but very quiet. Whilst clearing our table between courses, a server managed to both almost shove me off my seat whilst squeezing between my wife and I and then spilled on me clearing a plate. Food wise, the level has gone down since our last visit in late 2017. The Patatas Bravas has moved from sublime to ridiculous and you have to search for tiny pieces of fingerling potato between oceans of sauce and onions(?). The Sobrasada and Razor Clams were amazing though. Overall a little disappointing."
JosephB,"Dined on September 8, 2019",5,Outstanding. One of our favorite NY spots.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 7, 2019",5,"It’s always exceptional. The food is off the charts... the wine selection is staggering, and the joy of watching the chillest chefs in the city casually throw together these little plates of gustatory art is unmatched."
TandT,"Dined on September 7, 2019",5,"Sit at the bar if you can. The restaurant is small and cozy - doesn’t feel cramped, just intimate and exciting. At the bar you can watch the chefs making everything in the kitchen behind the bar, which was really fun. This was a great meal - excellent wine recommendations by the staff and the food was amazing. Lives up to the hype."
christianb,"Dined on September 5, 2019",5,"This is my go to for business lunches. It’s typically not over crowded, so you get the benefit of even more attentive service, plus, Jahdea, the host and sommelier, is awesome and always makes me feel like a rock star!"
Cecil,"Dined on September 1, 2019",3,"I was expecting excellent food but not everything was as good as expected. We have visited the place years ago and was excellent. Portions are small which I don’t mind when the food is delicious. Of our 6 orders we found only 3 very good, sardines, croquetas  and spaghetti with clams and chorizo which was the best.  Service was ok. Dessert was good different."
FrancisDoverian,"Dined on August 31, 2019",5,Excellent food. Very accommodating and friendly service.
Darv,"Dined on August 31, 2019",4,My partner loves this place and always asks to dine there when we are in NYC. Food is consistently great with thoughtful preparations. She loves the Sweetbreads and I love the Skirt Steak but had an excellent Lamb Chop this last time. Wine menu in Spanish is a bit confusing at times but staff help you navigate it. The only negative is the table spaces are very cramped in most of the restaurant. Overall we keep coming back so that says something.
LaFleur,"Dined on August 19, 2019",5,"Staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. Loved the ensalada, razor clams, pulpo, setas, confit goat, scallops. New plancha cook was on point. Great service from Stacey. Counter seating a must."
NicoleF,"Dined on August 19, 2019",5,One of my favorite restaurants!
Nina,"Dined on August 16, 2019",4,"Service was great. Food was pretty good. However, cheese served on salad was just the crust.  I ordered the 5 spice lamb chop. They told me that it would take sometime to cook. When all entrees were served they told me my order was never launched so I had to quickly change to another dish to be able to eat with everyone else.  I was surprised to see they charged me for my dish when they made a horrible mistake for a Michelin rated star."
Duckie,"Dined on August 15, 2019",4,"We went in a week day lunch taking advantage of the restaurant week menu, the food did not disappoint, very up to par ingredients served . Table service good .

BJChelsea,"Dined on August 6, 2019",3,"I had great hopes for this restaurant. I went for lunch with a friend during restaurant week. Understanding it’s a tapas restaurant, the portions did not meet its description of lunch. I had Bacalao croquettes to start. Yes the cod is salted, but it was overly salted. The sauce was heavy and unappealing. So the dish was heavy on heavy. For my main I had Gazpacho with Dorado. The postage size  piece of fish was tasty. Sadly the soup was more of a sauce (very thick). The wine, a Navarro rose was great. The restaurant itself is very small and tightly packed tables. Service was perfectly fine. The restaurant has a Michelin Rosette and so I left confused. Unless the restaurant week menu was an afterthought, perhaps the main  menu is better. It’s a sad thing when restaurant week is many times the initial introduction to the cuisine of a restaurant. It didn’t work. I ned not return."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 30, 2019",5,"Epic dishes. We had the lamb, foies gras, and the razor clams, which were absolutely amazing."
KarenHNYC,"Dined on July 28, 2019",5,excellent late afternoon lunch/early dinner ahead of a very early show.  The food was excellent. Service was excellent. The place is small (read: intimate) but a real find.  Thank you!
hypercritical,"Dined on July 26, 2019",5,Went for restaurant week lunch and they had an extensive menu. Had dorado with gazpacho for main course which was excellent with perfectly cooked dorado. Salad with manchego for first course which was simple but well done. Outstanding chocolate can galleta for dessert. The room is kind of small with moderate noise level when half full at lunch. I suspect higher energy in evening when tables full.
AmyP,"Dined on July 26, 2019",3,"The waiter seems very upset when I asked for balsamic vinegar because it is a Spanish restaurant. When I asked for any vinegar at all, he told me he has sherry vinegar but he is sure I won't like it. We waited for an hour between our appetizer to main entry. The over all experience was poor"

Phoenixnupe,"Dined on July 7, 2019",5,"Wow!!  Just wow!!  Aside from the seating being a little tight, the food was just outstanding and the service was on point the entire night!!  The Black Bass was incredible!!  Why the sauce is not served here in the US more is astounding to me!!  Oxtail stuffed peppers was amazing!!!  Red snapper was incredible!!!  5 spice rack of lamb was cooked to perfection!!  No wonder this is a Michelin restaurant!!!  Worthy of all the accolades!!!!!  What an experience!!!  Run don’t walk down here!!  It’s small so make a reservation!"
EdRR,"Dined on July 5, 2019",2,I was extremely disappointed by this place. The place is small and the tables are almost on top of each other. The staff is not very nice including the hostess who needed an attitude adjustment that day. Maybe she was having a bad day. The food was definitely not what I was expecting. My pulpo was burned. This is not a place I would recommend. It was a disappointment.

Wine list is well-selected (very well selected) but not much there for The budget conscious.  A go-to fave."
BEall,"Dined on June 3, 2019",5,"We are thanking our friends for recommending this restaurant to us. We loved the food. It is a tiny place, perhaps the only minus being that seating is tight. The sides are open, though, weather permitting, which is very nice in general and also keeps you connected to the pleasant surrounding neighborhood."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 27, 2019",5,Best food and wine pairing. Would go back.. again.. and again!
RandR,"Dined on May 23, 2019",4,"The food at Casa Mono was incredibly delicious - and some dishes delicately layered with many unique flavors.  The problem with that is that it was incongruous with the loud, energetic atmosphere.  The more complex dishes were hard to appreciate in their entirety, which is a shame as they are indeed delicious.  Our server, Joro, was outstanding and made the night just that more enjoyable."
MandyH,"Dined on May 22, 2019",3,"The food itself was very tasty. However, they were not kidding when they said the portions were plats and require about 8-12 of plats to feed a table of four. The food came on tiny plates and as someone who can barely finish a bowl of ramen, I walked out of the restaurant hungry. We weren't sure if we liked the taste so we ordered five plats for four people. Usually, this was more than enough for us. However, we each had one single bite out of each dish. It also didn't help the dining experience that the servers took forever to refill our water and get us that missing set of silverware for our fourth person."
LoriK,"Dined on May 22, 2019",5,Food was FABULOUS and wine list incredible.  This was our first time dining at Casa Mono so we went with our waiter’s recommendations.  They were excellent and the wine pairings perfect.  Can’t recommend this establishment highly enough!
BunnyRabbit,"Dined on May 21, 2019",4,"Exceptional food and a decent selection of Spanish wines. It's a bit tight and it doesn't feel like you're at a great place, but don't be fooled!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 20, 2019",3,"We were recommended to go to Casa Momo for a group of work colleagues that were there last year. We were very exited about going and me specially since i leaved in Spain for 7 years and LOVE their food and people. Overall experience was ok only because our server recommendation was not accurate at all, we were 4 women's she recommended 3 plates each since they were small, i know tapas are small but 3 each seems a lot specially when prices are not Spanish tapas prices. We ask if we could request some and see how we were going and request a few more after, she said no since the kitchen like to have all the order together, well in Spain you ask tapas as you go so little disappointed there . We went with the server recommendation...big mistake by the tame we got our last round of food they took the plates without being touch big waste of food and money. All the rest was fine ambience food was excellent and the fact our plates and silverware were changed every time was nice too. Will definitely come back but not following server advice ."

LucijaB,"Dined on May 11, 2019",5,"It was much better than i expected. Great food, good ambiance, cute little restaurant with casual atmosphere. We enjoyed every dish on our table, very interesting and unique taste. Loved it! Will definitely come back"
WilliamW,"Dined on May 6, 2019",5,"My wife and I sat at the bar for drinks and dinner, and had a fantastic waitress, named, I believe, Anna.  he gave us suggestions, all of which were delicious.  The restaurant had a fun neighborhood vibe."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 4, 2019",5,"Very good, creative menu"
LenaH,"Dined on May 3, 2019",3,Good food served in such a small room that the servers aren’t even used to their restricted space.  A bit uncomfortable since they are usually bumping into your chair :/
JonMero,"Dined on April 30, 2019",5,"Fun,delishious and worth every penny!"
jbeats,"Dined on April 30, 2019",5,"You go for the food, which is superior... space is tight but welcoming and you can definitely talk to you companion (unlike other small places, think Mimi’s which is intolerable)... and the wine list is spectacular.  The food is super exciting without being weird - pitch perfect!"
ADeatwell,"Dined on April 26, 2019",2,"Have been here many times over the years. This time the food was very uninspiring. The fedios were tasteless and greasy, with almost no chorizos and few tiny clams. The duck was a very small portion. The creme  brûlée was more carmelized sugar than anything else, and the fried bay leaf was absurd, since we were warned not to eat the bay leaf. Tables as always are right on top of one another and the service was very slow!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 25, 2019",5,All dishes i ordered were really great Service was good but a bit noisy to talk I always highly recommend this place to my friends
EugeneF,"Dined on April 20, 2019",4,The food and wine is always stellar. I especially loved the creme brûlée with the fried bay leaf donuts.
francoiseJ,"Dined on April 18, 2019",4,"Both the food and the service were excellent.  My main criterion for restaurants these days is to discover something I would not know how to make at home, and this restaurant qualifies.  The flavors are a very successful and unusual blend of ingredients, creative but not weird, and the small plates allow for sampling a wide range of tastes.   Our server, Anna, was knowledgeable, efficient but not overbearing, a delight also.  We shall be back."

LuisR,"Dined on April 9, 2019",5,Absolutely my favorite tapas restaurant in the US. Been a fan since 2010.  Gets better every year.  Love the staff and the food.  There is no better Spanish wine menu anywhere in the country.  Big fan
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 7, 2019",5,Red snapper was to die for and the service was impeccable! Look forward to going back
Phbnyc,"Dined on April 6, 2019",4,"We'd been several times to Casa Mono, always loving it, but it had been a while since our last visit. This was a slightly disappointing experience in that despite my having specified when I made the reservation that it was my husband's birthday, when we ordered dessert there was no acknowledgment of the occasion. In the past when we go out to a nice restaurant on a special occasion, they put a candle in the dessert and/or write ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate. Something! This time, nothing. That was kind of disappointing. Also, the waiter was slightly aloof and splashed some wine when he poured it for us. Felt rushed."
M2MHNWBend,"Dined on April 2, 2019",5,Wonderful and authentic Spanish tapas. Great flavor combinations and extensive wine selection. Sit at the kitchen bar area and watch the food artists at work.
JoeP,"Dined on March 30, 2019",5,"I’m not a Michelin reviewer, but I think I understand why they have received a star for at least the seven years.  The pulpo was amazing, I brought my 11 and 13 year old as well as my 79 year old mother and my wife.  3 generations ate and enjoyed a terrific meal.   My favorite restaurant in NYC!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 17, 2019",5,"Casa Mono is one of my happy places. The food is impeccable. The wine deliriously wonderful. James  D. has been my server a few times now and never steers me wrong.   I sit at the bar drinking wine ,eating and reading  contentedly."
BradTrent,"Dined on March 17, 2019",5,"This place always delivers. The food is continually spot-on, the staff is lovely and it all adds up to the most unfussy one-Star dining experience I can think of."
RXK8198,"Dined on March 17, 2019",4,"Overall an excellent meal, very good wines by the glass.  Tapas consistently of a high standard. The experience was marred, however, by the ""helicopter"" waiter--not working our table--who as he passed our table swooped in to take dishes off the table without asking, took my plate while my wife was still eating, grabbed the wine carafes before they had been emptied.  Never stopped to pour the wine. This showed a lack of training or, if trained in this way, then it reflected a strategy to rush diners along--either way not acceptable."
BrianB,"Dined on March 14, 2019",5,"Not to be dramatic- but best, most innovative food in the city in a casual atmosphere in a great neighborhood."
KateH,"Dined on March 14, 2019",3,"I have to be honest, it was hard for me to even enjoy my food and wine with the chaos of this restaurant.  I have a hard time understanding how this restaurant deserves a Michelin star with the noise levels and general overcrowded nature of the restaurant."
Sbb70,"Dined on March 12, 2019",5,Casa Mono is consistent in serving delicious meals and great wine. You can’t go wrong!

RonanW,"Dined on February 20, 2019",3,"Been a big fan for many years, at most recent dinner here I noticed the first fall off in food quality I have ever seen here. The razor clams were fundamentally disappointing for example."
Taste,"Dined on February 19, 2019",4,I love the food and wine at Casa Mono. The muscles with chorizo currently on the menu is bowl licking good. Everything is tasty and will remind travelers of Spain. I love that they change the menu up seasonally to keep things fresh. It's just a little louder and more cramped than I would like. I'll go back for the food of course.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 16, 2019",5,Food is always off the charts - amazing meal. Servers could have been a little more friendly otherwise a great experience as always
Atul,"Dined on February 13, 2019",5,"Enjoyed a birthday lunch.   Was greeted with a glass of champagne by our server, Stephanie.     The entire meal and experience was amazing."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 9, 2019",1,"Incredibly disappointed with casa mono.   Some of the food came out cold (lamb chops) and the waiter said—these just came off the grill.  -no need to argue with us.  They were cold.   Our other dishes were mediocre and overall, just a bad meal...and not cheap either.   I am almost always satisfied/happy with every nyc dining experience and casa Mono simply failed at food and service."
jacquelineW,"Dined on February 6, 2019",1,"PRETENTIOUS, PRETENTIOUS, PRETENTIOUS  FOOD!!!!!! I HAVE HAD SOME BAD MEALS IN NYC BUT THIS RANKS UP THERE IN THE TOP 3!!!!! FIRST YOU NEEDED A MAGNIFYING GLASS TO SEE THE FOOD!!!! WHEN THE SO CALLED BACALAO CROQUETAS CAME OUT I KNOW I WAS IN FOR A DISASTROUS  MEAL!!!!  I HAVE HAD FROZEN FISH STICKS THAT TASTE BETTER AND THE JARRED AIOLI SERVED WITH IT TASTED LIKE IT WAS FROM THE JAR. THE RESTAURANT ADVERTISED OXTAILS WHAT A SURPRISE WHEN THOSE 2 LITTLE PEPPERS CAME TO MY TABLE WITH MAYBE 2 OZ. OF SHREDDED MEAT INSIDE (NEXT TIME MY AUNT MAKES OXTAILS I'LL INVITE THE CHEF OVER TO SHOW HIM HOW THIS DISH IS DONE) THE ONLY SAVING GRACE OUT OF THIS DISASTER WAS THE SWEET LADY WHO WAITED ON ME. I WON'T BE GOING BACK TO THIS CRUMMY RESTAURANT AND I WON'T BE RECOMMENDING IT TO ANYONE EITHER"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2019",4,Bacalao croquetas were a little too salty. Foie gras was great. Oxtail stuffed in peppers was also creative and delicious. Nice wine list.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 1, 2019",5,Nice and tasty place for tapas or small sharing plates.

TimberMom,"Dined on January 24, 2019",4,"The food was delicious, I must say. Our server was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable, courteous - I was very happy. they had interesting wine choices, and the glasses were nice (simple, thin, with the right sound & weight). We went for the Restaurant Week lunch. It was a 2-course, not 3, and the main dish was basically a tapas size, I thought. The ambiance is ok but not particularly special, and very little room to maneuver between tables. Pricy & small servings - but very delicious:))"
YvonneM,"Dined on January 23, 2019",5,"Visiting from out of town, this was our first visit to Casa Mono. We went for a Wednesday lunch and did not have to wait to be seated. The restaurant was about half full. We sat at the counter where we could watch the food being prepared. It was Restaurant week, so there was a fixed price menu. I had the salt cod croquettes, which were very tasty, with a citrus aioli , which I found to be a little oily. For main course I had the dorado fish with a red pepper almond sauce. It was delicious. As a starter my friend had the meat croquette and then the oxtail stuffed peppers, both of which he enjoyed a lot. He had the only beer on the menu and I had a carafe of the house white. Both were very nice and reasonably priced. The restaurant is small but it was not too crowded so that was fine. The servers were all very pleasant and friendly, helping to explain the menu - which we needed. It was an excellent experience and I would not hesitate to go back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 23, 2019",4,Food is very good! The service is 7.5/10.  Will recommend to my friends because of the taste of the food.

carylnyc,"Dined on January 19, 2019",5,Have been meaning to go to Casa Mono for years --so happy to have made it finally. All the foods we ate were delicious --variety of fish and lamb and veggies.......all tasty.  Tables are small and shaky --but adds to relaxed atmosphere ---
jhh1,"Dined on January 18, 2019",4,Great food in a cramped space.  But not cheap.  Worth the trip for the food.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 15, 2019",3,"Let’s get the bad stuff out of the way first.    The noise level is horrific.   You can only talk to someone else by shouting with your head bent towards them.    The illumination is so low that we were not able to read the menu or the wine list.    I could not read the numbers on the check when it came time to pay.   A waitress read them for me.  The staff were very helpful.    The food is really good.     If conversation over dinner is important, this is not the place to go.    Bring your own illumination, then you will be able to read the menu, wine list and check.    What a pity.    If only we could get the food without the noise."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 30, 2018",5,Food is excellent as usual. Wine and dessert Recs were great too

maubo,"Dined on December 28, 2018",5,100 por ciento recomendable es pequeño el lugar pero acogedor la comida muy buena e innovadora en cada platillo pruebas algo nuevo y diferente no es tan caro aunque tampoco es un lugar barato. A mi en lo personal no me encantan las tapas y aun asi lo disfrute mucho y el trato fue bueno. Un detalle curioso aunque el restaurante es de inspiracion española la musica que ponen es primordialmente latina por lo que me senti como en casa aunque hubiera estado bien escuchar algo español.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 21, 2018",5,The food was excellent the waiter was great unfortunately the manager could not accommodate another person at our table and we had to leave.

NickT,"Dined on December 6, 2018",5,"Highlight of our NY trip. We honestly didn’t know what we had gotten ourselves in to, but the food was so diverse and wonderful. Nothing disappointed. We experienced nothing but great food the whole week, but this came out on top. The dining area is a little cramped but that quickly leaves your mind once the food arrives.   Pro Tip: arrive a little early and head over to their wine bar next door. They will bring your drinks to your table if you’re called over and the place is super cool.  Have to get: Scallops in Green Curry if still available."

AJDEsq,"Dined on December 2, 2018",3,"Fourth or Fifth visit to Casa. Quality of the food is there but that's about where the positives end. Very, very cramped seating. Very difficult to be comfortable. Not inexpensive so if you are ok shelling out while being cramped then fine, but it's a tough slog to pay up and yet not be able to be relaxed."
local,"Dined on December 2, 2018",5,"I love the place. the menu is creative and I try to get in there once a year. This time 4 out of five of the dishes were outstanding but one fell short. The Cod Cheeks needed another minute under the broiler because they were too raw even for me and a bit chewy. Besides that minor glitch, the place rocked and I will be back. Keep in mind that this is a tiny space with small tables so, if your planning on taking out your ""BIG FRIEND"" perhaps you re-think this spot or call the hostess and ask for one of the larger tables."
LJOB,"Dined on December 1, 2018",5,"If you are a tapas fan and you ou want the best of the best, this place is for you.  We opted for a lunch visit as we couldn’t get an evening reservation. First advice ...sit at the bar so you can watch the magic happen. The food is absolutely delicious!!  We couldn’t stop ordering as we wanted to try everything, and each dish was fabulous in its own right.  A few highlights include the grilled octopus paired with grapefruit segments, fluke with radish and pineapple salsa, goat confit (a 24 hour process to make), razor clams (one my must haves when on the menu), lamb sausage, and sea urchins with beautiful creamy scrambled egg.  Now you understand why we had to cancel our dinner reservation!!  The food and atmosphere are amazing!!  You won’t be disappointed!!!"

AntonioB,"Dined on November 24, 2018",1,Never got a table. Hostess was very unpolite
Delicious,"Dined on November 17, 2018",2,"By New York standards, I was not impressed with Casa Mono. For Spanish fusion tapas style food I found it to fall short. It was overpriced for the portions and I didn’t find the risks taken with the cuisine to be worthwhile. The lamb with tomatillo sauce was quite disappointing and actually undercooked. (I say this as a medium rare girl, who doesn’t even mind it a hair closer on the rare side.)  It was decent in that it was cozy and charming. The marmalade and sobrasada appetizer was a redeeming part of the meal, but not worth a second visit."
SusanS,"Dined on November 15, 2018",5,The food and everything else were wonderful.  My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I hadn’t been there in years but now look forward to getting there often

hoipolloi,"Dined on November 10, 2018",3,Food was great as always. Just because you sit at the bar doesn’t mean that you should be ignored/invisible.   Zero hospitality and a big let down.
Douglas,"Dined on November 9, 2018",5,"Always consistently excellent, with friendly and helpful staff"
ymmmy,"Dined on November 5, 2018",5,Great food. We ordered 5 small plates and 1 dessert for 2 people. Loved 5 out of the 6 dishes. We were a little uncertain about the sea urchin with walnuts but the ingredients are of good quality. The foie gras is one of the best I had in the city so far (though the sauce could be a little less salty). Our server is very friendly and passionate. Definitely on the list of worth revisiting.
LW007,"Dined on November 4, 2018",5,Phenomenal experience at Casa Mono. Every bite was an explosion of flavor and savored every bite. The sommelier helped us pick an amazing bottle of wine which was superb with the meal. Highly recommend for special occasions. It is expensive but definitely worth it.

NIcholas,"Dined on September 21, 2018",4,"2nd time I have had lunch at Casa Mono.  I love sampling lots of different things and the wide variety of the menu is perfect.  The chef has taken some creative license with traditional Spanish tapas and in every instance I tried, the outcome was delicious.  I have not eaten a lot of goat in my lifetime but I will certainly order goat when I next return to Casa Mono!  Great desserts as well."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 8, 2018",4,food is  really nice and beyond expectation. Unfortunately they sold out razor when we came.
soprano,"Dined on August 5, 2018",4,"Excellent cuisine, but a bit too rushed. I took my daughter here for lunch. We ordered four dishes - (1) Confit Goat with Avocado Queso, Scallion Ash, and Pistachios; (2) Creamy Eggs with Sea Urchin, Walnuts, Lime and Ancient Anchovy Oil; (3) Fluke Crudo with Blood Orange, Lemon and Ancho Dust; and (4) Scallops with Serrano Pepper Green Curry and Minted Cashews. All four were very good but only two were outstanding. Both of us found the creamy eggs with sea urchin just a bit too rich. We loved the confit goat and the avocado in that dish was extraordinary (seemed to be grilled, bursting with flavor). We also loved the scallops with green curry. The fluke crude was okay but not that interesting. So we'd go there again, but we'd be careful about ordering. However, one thing that wasn't great is that we were essentially rushed through our meal. Between when we arrived and when we got our bill was maybe 30 or 40 minutes. A bit too fast for any Michelin starred restaurant.  Not sure how to get them to slow down."

Cafoodie,"Dined on June 20, 2018",5,"Our soft eggs with Uni was done perfectly. The small plates of quail and fois gras were tender & delicious. Bread pudding and Crema Catalana were yummy. Good service by our server Erik.  Impressive was  manager Jahdea who was most friendly and attentive, checking on us frequently to make sure every plate was to our satisfaction. Casa Mono is lucky to have such outstanding manager."
MarcFromNYC,"Dined on June 9, 2018",3,"Space is very tight and can be a bit uncomfortable.  While food was excellent, service was a bit unprofessional.  They were nice and friendly, however, they brought items out of order after insisting that we order all items at once."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 18, 2018",3,"This was my third time to visit Casa Mono , last time was a couple of years ago and it was so good I wanted to go again. It wasn’t that good. The croquetas de bacalao were too cooked so you couldn’t taste the fish at all. The service was very good."
Hamilton,"Dined on May 2, 2018",4,Dishes we really loved:  -pig ear chilaquiles -fideos -merguez sausage
ClydeT,"Dined on April 30, 2018",5,"A birthday dinner for a friend. I have eaten at Casa Mono many times. The food is always superb and the tapas format allows one to sample a variety of unusual dishes. The creamy eggs with sea urchin was my favorite. The seating is very tight which is why I prefer to eat at the bar. What is my overall assessment of Casa Mono? I don’t return to a restaurant that doesn’t satisfy my quest for great food. As I said at the beginning, I have eaten at Casa Mono many times."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 22, 2018",5,"One of the best restaurants in the city!! You have to try the Spanish sobrasada and Foie gras with cinco cebollas, everything on the menu was so good!!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 1, 2018",2,Service is poor but food is delicious.

Amy1,"Dined on March 4, 2018",4,"We’ve been to casa mono many times, and have never been disappointed. Love the food; everything’s unique and delicious!  Excellent professional service, including a knowledgeable sommelier and a helpful waiter.  Can’t wait until our next meal at casa mono!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 3, 2018",5,スペインで食事しているような雰囲気の良いレストランでした。
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 27, 2018",2,"all dishes we ordered came out cold and everything was under-seasoned. the new system where the waiter brings you an ipad to pay and stands over you while you select your tip, which is calculated as double when you split the bill between 2 cards is tacky and uncomfortable."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 25, 2018",3,The food was excellent. The restaurant was way too cold. The sever rushed us...
carolt,"Dined on February 22, 2018",1,Be prepared for hideous crowding and painful noise.

susanjo,"Dined on February 19, 2018",5,Post matinee at Classic Stage nearby. They were out of razor clams but that was the only disappointment! Still my favorite NYC restaurant!!
SigG,"Dined on February 17, 2018",2,"It is a small restaurant on the corner, quite cute, but honestly I could not understand why they have one michlen star. There is nothing remarkable or unique about it. Yes it is nice and interesting concept of small plates which typically you would need 5-8 for two. There are around 12 tables, the seating is not  comfortable, very small tables and chairs so its a challenge to try to fit right and we struggled. Service is fair, but not excellent, waiter was quite impatient and gave judgmental looks when you would ask to repeat or exlain stuff, but on a positive note brought everything we ordered without time wait, Some dishes were good, while others like sausage for example was very salty  and not tasting so great so i could not finish it. Desserts were not delicious at all. place was clean, including the bathroom. But in my opinion not worth the price tag and nothing to remember about."
AlexA,"Dined on February 10, 2018",3,"I was ready for an amazing meal but was really disappointed. Maybe it's just what we ordered, but the only one worth talking about is the Razor Clams which were delicious. Otherwise, everything else was either too bland (croquetas de bacalao), too greasy (pork croqueta) or just not impressive (fideos). I love Battali's other restaurants, but Casa Mono didn't hit the mark for me. I might try again during dinner and get different dishes (other than the clams), but for brunch this is a huge pass for me."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 7, 2018",5,Fantastic food and service
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 1, 2018",5,"We have been coming here for 10 years, never disappointed with any of their dishes or wine."
RowlandH,"Dined on February 1, 2018",3,Restaurant Week- The food was well prepared but the entree portion wouldn’t have fed a pigeon. It was more of a snack than a meal. The dessert was awful- Two stale cinnamon buns around some ice cream. Way below Casa Mono’s standards.
ArgenmexFamily,"Dined on January 29, 2018",3,I ordered octopus and it was really hard. My husband ordered the bone marrow and he really enjoyed it.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 28, 2018",5,It was one of the best meals I’ve had in a very long time!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 27, 2018",5,We had an amazing experience celebrating our anniversary! We’ve been there many times but Fernando made it extra special. Thank you!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 27, 2018",5,Visited Casa Mono for NY Restaurant Week & wasn’t disappointed. The food is impressively fresh & the staff is very attentive (they came over to level our table).
Writergirl2009,"Dined on January 26, 2018",5,"When I got to Casa Mono, I was a little cranky. But the staff there were so patient and attentive, my bad mood disappeared quickly. The food was outstanding and my best friend, who is not food adventurous, said he would love to go back and try some of the other dishes. He thought the mussels were spectacular!  I’m definitely looking forward to visiting this place again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 24, 2018",3,Serving size is not enough and very small
zip10010,"Dined on January 17, 2018",5,"We reconnend the Pulpo with grapefruit, grilled sardines, fried quail, scallops with green curry. If possible, sit at the kitchen counter to watch the masters at work. Beware of the loud sound volume of the venue, it is not rimantic but fine for a casual dinner."
BenM,"Dined on January 14, 2018",3,This is one of our favorite spots but the food was not as memorable tonight as it usually is
WilliamP,"Dined on January 14, 2018",4,“Sometimes monkey business is the best business of all” -curious george
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 12, 2018",5,The food was simply amazing. Even thought they are tapas (small portions) the food is really worth trying. The service was also great. everyone was so attentive. I am definitely going back!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 10, 2018",5,Casa Mono is always the best food and wine period. When I eat at the bar I always meet interesting people and have great conversations. The waitstaff are friendly and helpful and well versed on the food. Order the razor clams. They will make you happy!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 8, 2018",3,"I had been to Casa Mono several times in the last decade.  Last time I went was probably two or three years ago. Since then the quality of the food has decreased while the value went up. Portions were smaller, flavors more bland, and every dish lacked that special kick that made Casa Mono one of my favorite places back in the day."
myosh,"Dined on December 23, 2017",5,"Food was excellent as usual.   The staff at the bar counter was little unfriendly, that was sad."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 30, 2017",1,"Disgusting, never going again. Worst service even by NY standard. Very rude staff and manager."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 27, 2017",5,Great wine bar with perfect sized and different tapas. Not the standard italian Mario Batalli comfort food.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 25, 2017",5,"Absolutely delicious food, we sat at the bar so we could see how they cook! Don’t miss it!  Well deserved that Michelin star!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 17, 2017",3,"Food was good, and I knew going in that it was a tapas restaraunt but I really wasn't expecting 3 scallops to split with my other friend.  The jamón was really good too, same with the steak! I'd check it out for sure"

ViX1,"Dined on October 28, 2017",4,"Overall, nice service. Wish the sommelier had more knowledge about wine"
Wawo,"Dined on October 25, 2017",3,"I've eaten here many times & the food is always fabulous!  The very small cozy restaurant had always been complimented by its choice of background (Mediterranean) music - which allowed you to carry on a conversation.  But not this time!  Suddenly there was hard rock BLASTING thru the restaurant, which I think was quite inappropriate.  When we said something to the hostess, she was totally rude & said that that was how Mario liked it.  Total lack of empathy for the customers!!!"
Juanga,"Dined on September 18, 2017",5,I had high hopes and the team at Casa Mono surpassed our expectations.  Wonderfully creative yet very approachable and delicious dishes.  The grilled avocado that came with the outstanding goat confit was perhaps the most impressive thing I have tasted in years.
DavidLJ,"Dined on September 1, 2017",4,Beautiful food Rude staff
Ktnyan,"Dined on August 24, 2017",5,THE BEST. Never have I been disappointed!

KenB,"Dined on August 14, 2017",4,"Excellent tapas...especially recommend the creamy eggs, razor clams, and bone marrow dishes. Lunch service was rather poor as our male waiter admitted that he was overwhelmed. But the food is excellent!!! We will go back. 👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 11, 2017",5,Easily the best dining experience in the city so far and reasonably priced for a Michelin star-rated restaurant.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 5, 2017",5,It's really a good place where you hang out with 2-3 friends and enjoying several small-dishes. Food is special and tasty!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 24, 2017",3,Hacen cocina española aceptable. La carta de vinos esconde joyas
ATS1,"Dined on June 18, 2017",5,"This was our second visit and loved it both times.  Hard to get a reservation, so both times we went at off peak.  The food is a step above tapas -- creative and generous portions.  The goat dish and stuffed quail were exceptional.  It's a small restaurant and the tables are tight, so be prepared for a cozy experience."
Mar2014,"Dined on June 17, 2017",5,"Casa Mono is one of this restaurants that you can not imagine will be so fantastic. A little tiny place full of fantastic meals. I personally like the fideos & chorizo, the duck and the huevos fritos con patatas as well are great. Almost like  in Casa Lucio in Spain!"
LaFleur,"Dined on May 28, 2017",5,"Wonderful meal sitting at chef counter. Enjoyed all the Spanish wines by the glass, ensalada Mono, razor clams, mussels, ramps, soft shell crab! Dinner and a show."
RichardD,"Dined on May 27, 2017",5,"Creative Cuisine. Saturday lunch does not need a reservation. Brought a foodie friend and enjoyed razor clams, bone marrow and other small plates."
WineMeUp,"Dined on May 23, 2017",3,Jammed into a tiny table in otherwise empty space.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 21, 2017",4,"Not bad - seating a little cramped, we opted to sit at the counter to have more room."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 18, 2017",5,"Fantastic! Best tapas I've ever had and I don't say that lightly. Every dish we tried ranged from great to brilliant. Especially tasty we're the dorado a la plancha and scallops with Serrano pepper curry. Heck, even simple stuff like the pan con tomato and ramps and romesco were outstanding. Very impressive for a mid afternoon lunch. You don't expect to get the same attention to detail you might get at busier times of the day. Service was attentive but unobtrusive. If you're nearby, go."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 13, 2017",5,One of my favorites in NYC!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 7, 2017",5,"Just perfect food and drinks! Best tapas, just compared to some in Spain."

Luppi,"Dined on April 28, 2017",5,"Tapas are delicious. Good wine by the glass. Nice service. Negative: although  the place was empty in  a very regular Friday after lunch time (2 pm) and threre was various free tables, I was moved to sit at the counter because of the ""house's rules""."
Bram,"Dined on April 28, 2017",5,"I went for a late lunch, and it was very comfortable, quiet, with excellent service, interesting wine, and excellent food."
PodF,"Dined on April 15, 2017",5,Top class food with exceptional and welcoming service. Treated like we were regulars even though it was only our second visit.

ItsGVH,"Dined on April 2, 2017",5,My wife and I have been going to Casa Mono since we first met and it never disappoints.  Sit at the bar/chef table enjoy the view of the chefs doing what they do best.    Casa Mono is our happy place.
LarryW,"Dined on March 27, 2017",3,Wife and I dined at Casa Mono on a Sunday evening while visiting NYC... we felt rushed..had to order all our plates..5 of them at the same time..we thought they would come one at a time..but no 2 came the as soon as they were done here come the other 3..several of the plates got cold..we had all of our plated within 20 minutes...I did talk to the manager and she took one plate off the bill explaining that this standard serving procedure for this restaurant ..we prefer more relaxed dining so I doubt we go back
RobertoV,"Dined on March 27, 2017",4,"It would be great if the chefs behind the counter would smile from time to time.  The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant, chefs should be open to it ..."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 21, 2017",3,"It was loud and really cramped and we were seated at a table with two strangers, which wasn't really ideal since my fiancé and I had gotten engaged earlier that night. Service was very good, food was solid."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 16, 2017",3,The food was good and so were the staff.  However it was big plate pricing for small (tapas) plates. The dining room is very small but cute. Needless to say I have had much better tapas for a fraction of the price.
Ktnyan,"Dined on March 12, 2017",5,My absolute favorite restaurant in NY. Never disappoints me. The counter in front of the chef is definitely recommended!
marty,"Dined on February 28, 2017",4,"Amazing food, notably the mackarel and flank steak.  The brussel sprouts were disappointing as they are deep friend but everything else was excellent.  The wine recommendation was also bang on."

JesperS,"Dined on February 26, 2017",4,"Very nice restaurant! We visited for a Saturday lunch in late February and had a mix of servings from the menu. Top service, extremely well tasting food. Great cozy/busy feel. We can imagine it gets even better on a warm summer evening!"

Tia99,"Dined on February 14, 2017",5,Wonderful Spanish restaurant.  Went on a Monday night and loved it.  Razor Clams are amazing!  Loved the Quail too.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 12, 2017",5,"Highlights included the pork belly, stuffed quail, and Fideos with chorizo and clams.  Fantastic wines by the glass as well.  The restaurant is pretty tight quarters but the service was fantastic and we received great recommendations."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 11, 2017",5,I'd been wanting to go here for ages but it was always booked.  My favorite dishes were the steak and the bruschetta but everything was good.  Really enjoyed the wine choices as well.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 11, 2017",5,"Great for late-night dining (it is Spanish-themed, after all).  The menu is beautifully conceived and executed and the wine list is outstanding.  Our waiter was very attentive.  A favorite when we are in New York."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 11, 2017",4,"Excellent tapas and larger plates, with good accompanying wine list. It's a snug place, so it gets a bit crowded fairly quickly. If you show up more than a few minutes before your reservation, they're liable to shunt you off to their Bar Jamon, next door, which is a good place to start your first glass of wine."
Nube,"Dined on February 11, 2017",4,Wonderful creative Spanish meal! The appetizers of fluke carpaccio and pan seared octopus were stellar as was the branzino.....
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 10, 2017",5,"Great food, but in small amount😂😂😂"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 9, 2017",4,Impecable service.
Atilla,"Dined on February 8, 2017",4,"Impressive.....even during restaurant week the menu, the kitchen and the staff are first rate.  Unlike some restaurants that prepackage (dear I say, 'reheat') or 'dumb down' their restaurant week offerings....not the case here....the dishes were every bit as good and prepared with the same level of attention as I have experienced during my other visits.    As always, I think the seating is not great (too cramped...hence the 4-star for overall), but the food is so good and the service so seamless that I take the seating as a price worth bearing in order to experience the food, service and 'feel' of this consistently good restaurant.  Highly recommended."
kave,"Dined on February 3, 2017",5,"We had a wonderful experience at Casa Mono! Everything was great - the delicious food prepared right in front of us, the courteous service, and cosy atmosphere! Definitely recommend and will come back to explore more."

alwayshungry,"Dined on January 23, 2017",4,"Despite being a rainy Sunday evening the restaurant was lively throughout our meal. The space is not large so the tables were close together but the unpretentious vibe gives it a cozy feel, as one would expect at a bar in Spain. Dishes are boldly flavored; the razor clams and charcuterie board I particularly recommend. Definitely leave room for dessert."
KatherineG,"Dined on January 23, 2017",4,Our waiter was fabulous. He helped w/wine selection and organizing our tapas order. Wine and food were very tasty.  Waiter was very helpful and customer conscious. Ambiance was comfortable. Tables are a little close as I kept bumping stuff when getting in/out. Minor. But glad mo one was sitting at next table;)
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 22, 2017",2,"Very small, cramped space, extremely loud music which led to diners nearly screaming to have a conversation.  The food was just ok.  We arrived around 10pm for our reservation and, given that it's a tapas place, we asked if could order a couple of dishes at a time, because even when the kitchen spaces them out, it all tends to come out very closely together.  Our server seemed annoyed with our request and then seemed to actively ignored us when we were ready to order.  By the time we had finished our first set of dishes, crudo and cod croquetas, the place was half empty, so I don't know why asking to take our time was such a big deal."
Amy1,"Dined on January 22, 2017",4,"Great neighborhood spot.  Wonderful food and wine, relaxing atmosphere, welcoming vibe.  What more could you ask for?"
108NYC,"Dined on January 21, 2017",5,Food was even better than I remembered (and that was very very good)! Outstanding. Service was incredible server was so knowledgeable. We were pre-theater 5:15 so may explain the quiet noise level. A real gem.
flo2lux,"Dined on January 20, 2017",5,Tapas at their best! I keep going and going to this small restaurant @ Irving place because their food is phenomenal and the atmosphere really good! Each tapas is tasty and their Spanish wines are really good. If you can have a place at the counter you can enjoy the cooking show ! One of my favorite place in the city
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 19, 2017",2,Poor food. Overpriced wines.
jrbernardi,"Dined on January 16, 2017",2,"The tables were tiny and packed together like cells in a beehive. Unfortunately they seated someone right on top of us. That person talked loudly and incessantly. I could barely hear what my guest was saying. The food was good, although too salty, even though we requested that they not oversalt."
DanZ,"Dined on January 15, 2017",2,"Honestly, for a Michelin star reataurant, I was disappointed. For the price, go to any one of the thousand other tapas restaurants in NYC. Service was great though. They really were on top of their game and had pride in their job, which was much appreciated during a mediocre meal. This place did not live up to the hype. Duck=chewy, quail=salty, goat=off putting, sea urchin=scrambled eggs (if you have had this dish you know what I mean). On the other hand, the burrata and fluke crudo were pretty good. Maybe I ordered the wrong items on the menu, but I definitely would not recommend nor will I go there again. As a Batali fan this was a total letdown."
FrankH,"Dined on January 15, 2017",5,What a great place.  Close to the subway.  Intimate setting.  Great wine list.  Great menu.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 14, 2017",5,"Great tapas bar, probably the best I've been to in Manhattan.  Jamon is the best in the city although not up to the same standards as the jamon in Spain. Great ambiance and great wine selection"
Fitzdrum,"Dined on January 6, 2017",1,"The food was outstanding and our server was fantastic. HOWEVER, the Hostess is not fit to work at any restaurant let alone an establishment that prides itself on quality. She opened the doors late, but worse, when a colleague joined us after we ran up a bill of $500+, she said we must move tables - the restaurant was half empty. In addition, the restaurant sent me a link to review the experience, but the site has a bug and my review could not be submitted. This occurred after I spent 10 minutes writing it. This WAS a great restaurant, but it is showing signs of failing. I can no longer recommend it."
KirstenP,"Dined on January 5, 2017",5,Wonderful intimate restaurant with inventive food.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 1, 2017",5,Amazing tapas! Great food such as the razor clams and the bone marrow! Try the baby clams! Great selection of Spanish wine! Great service and ambience! Will return!!!
rons,"Dined on December 31, 2016",5,We cannot come and visit NYC without dining at Casa Mono. It is truly our favorite restaurant in Manhattan!
Doug,"Dined on December 30, 2016",3,"I wish it is more value based then just tasting the larger than tapas.   Also, the wine menu should be more like the European style rather than the US wine menu style.   Maybe I had too much expectation for Casa Mono being all the stars (from NYT and Michellin) but I was somewhat disappointed.   I still like the bone marrow and squids but others were not outstanding...."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 29, 2016",5,My husband and I absolutely love Casa Mono! Every dish here is phenomenal...expertly prepared with quality ingredients! Highly recommend this restaurant to all my friends who are foodies!

Had the meat & cheese plate, Brussels sprouts, scallops,  salad, quail, razor clams, lamb, skirt steak, chocolate ganache, and creams brûlée. We loved it all. It was a fun experience too with the small plates."
Marietta,"Dined on December 19, 2016",4,"Casa Mono was just as good as I remember it 7 years ago. Beautiful room, even better food. We let the waiter pick 7 tapas for us. All were great. Fideos were exceptional. Order a Cortado with your dessert."
oanjao,"Dined on December 17, 2016",5,"Casa Mono is a tiny little tapas restaurant with a lot of character. It's expensive, but it's a good value for a special occasion. The food was excellent, and even the cheapest ""by the glass"" wines are good. You can spend as much as you want to on wine at Casa Mono."
jenesais,"Dined on December 15, 2016",4,"Strangely quiet even for a lunch time, thank goodness. This is a tiny space usually only do-able for the slim with perfect hearing and no intimacies to convey across the minute tables."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 13, 2016",3,"The food was excellent but the hostess rushing us through dinner and wine at the end of the meal because ""the next reservation had already arrived and was waiting"" completely ruined the experience for us. The poor review on service doesn't reflect our waiter, who was lovely."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 12, 2016",5,"Great. The food is great, the atmosphere is great, the staff are attentive....it. Is a brilliant restaurant where you feel like you could sit for an entire evening. Perfect"
JoeP,"Dined on December 10, 2016",5,"We had the last reservation of the night, and sat at the bar in front of the kitchen.  From the recommendation of the wine, to the recommendations for dinner, everything was terrific.  Although we were the last out, we never felt rushed.  An absolutely fantastic place."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 9, 2016",2,"It's been a while since I've been here, but I was sadly disappointed with the food.  In the past, it has been inventive and flavorful, but I found it bland and unexciting this time.  We had the pan con tomate, squid, duck breast and scallops.  It made me sad that it wasn't a great meal."
gregs,"Dined on December 9, 2016",5,Great restaurant.  A young Chef named Tyler was amazing to watch work.  Dishes are so creative and the atmosphere is energetic.  One of NY's best.
LJVPB,"Dined on December 7, 2016",4,"This is a cozy, comfortable place with knowledgeable servers. The dishes were very good to outstanding. We shared four plates and two different wines and we were quite happy with our experience. We'd eat here again!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 4, 2016",5,Each dish better than the next. One of a kind in NYC. Feels like you are in Spain.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 4, 2016",5,This was our second time eating here in the past month or so.  We travel a lot so we are afforded the opportunity to eat great food from all over.  With out a doubt this is our favorite restaurant all around.  We can not wait to come back again.  The bone marrow rocks!!!!
JoeB,"Dined on December 3, 2016",5,Awesome place.   Very diverse small plates menu Excellent service.    I stop here every time I come to Manhattan.

Mike,"Dined on December 3, 2016",5,The cafe is very intimate and therefore a bit loud but also very cozy.
RichardM,"Dined on December 3, 2016",4,"First visit, thoroughly enjoyable, early dining before it became too boisterous (for us).  The sausage, duck, scallops and snapper were all delicious with seasonings and variations from the usual.  The ""Spanish prosecco"" was a good start to the meal, and the overall wine selection opened up new tastes."
Choly,"Dined on December 2, 2016",3,Too many tables crammed into a very small space. Food was pretend Spanish. The only acceptable dish was pan con tomate and the crema catalana. Do not waste your time or money. Very disappointed.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 28, 2016",5,Small and cozy!  Outstanding wine and food!  Service was attentive but not overbearing! Home run in my opinion. I cannot wait to go back.
RedGinji,"Dined on November 28, 2016",4,I had the roasted marrow bones. Simply delectable. The accompanying mushrooms and toast were perfection. More imagination.  Better than I have had in Paris! My husband had the lamb sausage and skiry steak. Both deLooking forward to trying more tapas.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 27, 2016",4,Was fine - nothing to write home about.  The space is nice but cramped.  Lots of servers but not much service - had to get up a few times to ask for things.  Food was nice but again was lacking the wow factor.  One notable dish was the brussel sprouts.
Warren,"Dined on November 27, 2016",4,"A very small restaurant with around 20 seats. Dishes were delicious and prices were reasonable, one issue is that when I asked for check they suddenly added a bottle of sparkling water into my check, which I think their service shouldn't be like that."
OlivierSaintVincent,"Dined on November 26, 2016",1,The Michelin Star is a real mistake : Spanish wines are only chosen because of high end price (when the Spanish wine market is still very affordable). Food is not even close from any tapas bar in Madrid. Service is rude.

lulu,"Dined on November 19, 2016",5,"We had a wonderful night at Casa Mon from start to finish. We were lucky and got a 10pm reservation on a weekend night just a couple of weeks in advance. We arrived a little early, but there was a table available so we sat down right away. The open kitchen was hopping and the crowd in the small space was happily engaged in conversation. It is not a quiet place, but you can hear the waiter and your dinner companions, and for me that is what matters.   There were just two of us, so we couldn't order everything we wanted to try, but that just gives us incentive to return. It was a great meal. Everything we ordered was good. The highlights for us were the quail with potato puree, the razor clams and the Salvador Dali egg with truffled celeriac soup -- and then the saffron ice cream!   For wine, since we were only two, we were happy to be able to select glasses of excellent varieties and we chose our different ones to try - none a disappointment,   This was a real treat and I thank my brother for the recommendation. We will return!"

LBNYC,"Dined on November 14, 2016",4,Wonderful food and knowledgeable server. We learned about the cuisine and a selection of sherry that complemented our meal perfectly.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 14, 2016",5,"We'd like to start by apologizing to the staff at Casa Mono for arriving much later than our reservation. We understand that that can sometimes be difficult to deal with. We are grateful for having been accommodated.  Dinner Wine: Les Paradetes 2011 (If I'm recalling correctly)  Dinner date with the girlfriend was great! Servers were friendly and managers were actively participating in the ongoings of service.  Word of advice: Never skip the Jamón Ibérico.   The Fideos dish is an all time favorite (We've had it before). The caramelized fideos with bits of chorizo remind me of a Dominican rice dish, Arroz con Fideos, commonly found at mom's dinner table. We also had a bone marrow dish whose succulent and earthy flavors carries the mind into the comfort zone. This dish can really set the mood for the rest of the evening. The sea urchin and creamy eggs was, by far, the most extravagant of the group. The dish, we felt, was well-balanced in its many layers. Each component held its own ground but came together quite profoundly. Eggs scrambled with a very healthy serving of olive oil were a great compliment to the sea urchin and a slight tinge of palette-cleansing bitterness from the lime zest to finish each bite.   Dessert was delicious but lacking in comparison to our savory tapas. The Helado de Azafrán,  for instance, was, in all likelihood, intended to be subtle in flavor. However, the mangos coupled with other fresh and dried fruit atop the bowl-shaped helado was perhaps too safe a choice for us.  Always a worthwhile trip to one of our favorite restaurants.  Buen provecho!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 13, 2016",4,"Really lively place, it was neat getting to see the cooks in action just feet away from you. The food is quite fantastic. The service from the host is amazing, but my server wasn't incredibly attentive or friendly. It's a really convenient way to have some amazing food in a great part of town."

Kmcc,"Dined on November 2, 2016",2,"This restaurant was honestly disappointing. I had very high hopes after reading many reviews about it and really wasn't blown away. The food was just ok, the service was just ok, and the setting itself was too."
DimiT,"Dined on November 1, 2016",4,"Very cozy space, friendly and attentive staff and some creative dishes. But 3/5 dishes were hit and miss, and the wine, unless you go for a very expensive one, was average - even average priced wines at this institution should be excellent."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 30, 2016",5,"The food is delicious and outstanding and the service is friendly and efficient.  The only drawbacks are that the tables are small, so one spends some time moving around plates and glasses, and the table bases are big, so sometimes it's a little tricky to figure out where to put your legs.  But the food makes up for all of that."

PamelaC,"Dined on October 25, 2016",4,"What a great birthday dinner for my 12 year old son. He is a foodie and tried everything. Great mussels with chorizo, pulpo, razor clams, steak, lamb sausage, fideos, patata bravas, mushrooms with garlic, and of course wine. He loved watching the open kitchen, and the service was great. I hadn't been in a long time and we'll definitely be back soon."

judiful,"Dined on October 18, 2016",1,When 1 of the two dishes we ordered for our  second course arrived we were told that they were out of the food we ordered 40 minutes after we placed the order.  They brought another dish 10 minutes later then after 10 more minutes brought our original order way past the time we wanted it and they only comped us for the dish they brought after we didn't want anything else. Food was very spicy garlicky but NOT fresh.
sher,"Dined on October 17, 2016",5,"At first we were disappointed because they did not have razor clams in menu but that was soon forgotten because everything we ordered was fabulous.  Service was excellent.  Great food and wine,  what more do you need."
dannyqg,"Dined on October 15, 2016",5,A nice surprise. Small restaurant but with fabulous food. Will definitely visit again.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 15, 2016",2,"The meal was very lackluster for the price. The house charcuterie was great, with the exception of the terrine, which was overwhelmingly salty. We ate the pan-asian squid next to an oddly flattened, chewy octopus pancake over chunks of smokey grapefruit in a bed of fennel. They were both excellent in concept, but poorly executed. The sausage in the cuttlefish was overcooked and rubbery, the dough fried on bay-leafs was undercooked with the creme brûlée... only the scallops were executed well. It was a disappointing meal that clocked close to $200 - there's many better expressions for that price."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 15, 2016",5,"Amazing experience -- as always. Work with the server to discuss each dish's nuances, so you get exactly what you want. Ask for help with the killer wine list as well"

Marisa,"Dined on October 13, 2016",3,"Host was terrible. A table for 4 was open and she made my table (reservation for 3) wait until 15 minutes past our reservation time for a smaller table. The table for 4 remained vacant for the next hour. I understand the need to fill tables according to group size. But I don't understand the lack of service.  On top of this, she was rude."

The tables are tight and you can hear your neighbor's conversations but all is forgiven with the warm inviting service and the amazing food!  I really like the atmosphere in the restaurant, had a energetic buzz.  We tried many dishes but the most memorable for me was the sweetbreads which I have never had before but an now intrigued to try from each new menu I come across.   Great lunch Casa Mono team - will be back, hopefully soon!"

DoctorJ,"Dined on October 3, 2016",4,We were a party of four and lucky enough to get a corner table at the window which afforded a bit more privacy and less noise than  tables in the middle of this small space. The helping sizes varies considerably which makes it difficult to order for a group; we ordered 7 dishes for four people which did turn out to be ample. We were underwhelmed by the cod croquettes but really enjoyed the confit of duck and the lamb sausage. The service was very good.

ACox,"Dined on September 12, 2016",5,"Casa Mono is a small, quaint little restaurant. Having the feeling of being a neighborhood place. The tables are small and close, the atmosphere energetic. The staff are friendly, with good if not quite great service. This was the second time I'd come here in 4 weeks. If I'd reviewed it the last time the food would have gotten, very good. Some dishes didn't really work, like the rabbit, the eggs and unit not enough uni. However those that did work soon prompted a return visit. This time everything was excellent, everything. The Sardines, the Goat and the Bone Marrow were exceptional. I should be back again in a few weeks! Well deserved Michelin Star."

Dave,"Dined on September 4, 2016",5,"Very creative cuisine.  Spanish tapas, but many of the dishes seemed to be created with a fine dining Japanese aesthetic in mind.  Have one of the drier sherries with your meal to get the maximum enjoyment of the flavors of the food - and of the sherry itself."
MichaelH,"Dined on September 3, 2016",4,"Food was solid ...with first-rate calamari.  Wine list frightening as to price - you must look hard for value.  Concern over allergies - as all food cooked on the same plancha - was exemplary.  Real concern!   Service mixed....friendly....but disorganized.  Got a crick in my neck looking for our waiter to refill glasses, order more wine, etc.  Tiny place which is much like a left-bank bistro .  The ""jamon"" was puzzling.  VERY pricey for fairly ordinary Spanish ham.  Our server told us it was"" the bottom of the top"".  NOT good value.   Menu a bit limited."
BrianB,"Dined on September 2, 2016",5,"Stunning food, service and wine pairings all in a casual yet sophisticated environment.  This is my favorite restaurant in nyc, and I have been living and aggressively eating in Manhattan for many years.  Tough to beat the creative and seasonal menu that is professionally prepared and delivered.  Sitting at bar watching the chefs and having to sommelier pair wines with the series of courses will make for one of the best meals you will ever have.    And finishing the meal with a visit next door to bar Jamon for Serrano, manchego and Rioja is a great approach.  Enjoy."
Micheke,"Dined on August 31, 2016",4,"A succulent slice of Spain  A charming, rustic, somewhat cramped space makes for the perfect spot for delicious intriguing and innovative tapas. At night it is a bustling place which can get a little overcrowded and hectic. At lunch however, it is somewhat more subdued and a fun place to sample some very interesting and somewhat intricate Spanish dishes.We enjoyed scrambled eggs and sea urchin, and a dish of sardines cooked three ways as our appetizers. Both dishes were quite delicious. The sardines, our favorite of the two consisted of one served raw and marinated, one grilled and one fried served alongside a bowl of perfectly dressed fresh cucumbers, tomatoes and red onions. Then on to our main course which consisted of bone marrow served with toast points and lamb belly, both absolutely delectable. We were both more than satisfied after quite the rich lunch but decided to try the brown butter tart nevertheless. OH MY…..it turned out to be the perfect way to end a lovely meal. The tart was made  with brown butter and topped with the creamiest of homemade CREME FRAICHE ice cream surrounded by sweet berries. I adhered to my three bite maximum regimen although it took quite a bit of will power...the dessert was simply so delicious. The entire experience was one of great pleasure from start to finish thanks to our lovely server, Caitlyn who recommended certain different dishes, and who was more than attentive, kind and on point. For someone who enjoys tasty innovative tapas-style fare, an energetic and vibrant somewhat noisy atmosphere, I highly recommend Casa Mono, a charming rustic Mario Batali venue on Irving Place!"
LaFleur,"Dined on August 29, 2016",5,"One of our fav NYC spots. Has a great vibe and authentic Spanish feel. Very cramped, but in a good way. Staff is fun and friendly. Love the razor clams, fish dishes, and veg/salads. Best selection of Spanish wines around."

WalterC,"Dined on August 26, 2016",5,"We had four dishes.  The scallops were just ok.  The melon with honey, jamon and Parmesan was superb.  The quail was perfect.  My favorite, the sweetbreads, the best.  Followed up by a cheese plate.  A few glasses of wine.  A perfect lunch."
Pearl1107,"Dined on August 24, 2016",5,"I went there for my husband's birthday. We love to go to Spain and miss foods there, so we decided to visit Casa Mono as a substitute. Everything we ordered were very tasty and the waiter we had was kind and efficient. The foods are more upscale-style and pricier than we usually eat in Spain, but I cannot complain. If we can get such a quality Spanish foods here in NYC, I am happy.  (pan con tomate, razor clams, pork belly, and croquetas are our favorites)"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 17, 2016",3,"Came here expecting amazing food based on the NYT's 3 star rating and review. Was quite disappointed with the food, everything We ordered was ok... But each plate was either missing something (a bit of crunch, a touch of acid to brighten it, etc) or had an execution problem. A soft shell fried crab sounded great on the menu, but came with a strawberry sauce that was simply overpowering and made the whole thing taste only of strawberries, drowned out the delicate taste of the crab. Some dishes were over seasoned. Our waiter rushed us to order and never came back to pour our wine, we had to pour our wine ourselves the whole evening."

RobertM,"Dined on August 13, 2016",5,"We came across this place a year or so ago when we realized we had time before the KMFDM show at Irving Plaza. A quick yelp search and here we were. We were so impressed with the overall meal and experience I made sure to make reservations for our Anniversary.  Another epic meal commenced. The foie gras was divine and the pulpo did not dissapoint again. Bone Marrow, Pork Belly and Burrata this place never lets u down. Perfectly balanced dishes meant to share. Do not hesitate to try new things. We will be back"
HungryInBrooklyn,"Dined on August 12, 2016",4,"We liked best the creamy eggs with uni, razor clams, and burrata.  Skip the foie gras which was served on soggy toast and completely overwhelmed by the sweet tangy sauce it was served in.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Cute intimate open space on the corner."
MargeauxH,"Dined on August 11, 2016",2,"Food was average at best and the service was adequate but nothing special.  They gave me my check without asking us if we wanted coffee or anything else because they had another reservation after us and wanted us out.  When we came in though someone was at the table we were supposed to be at so they made me wait at the small bar next door, and then sat us at another table, so clearly those people were not forced out for us."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 9, 2016",5,Those razor clams are just so delicious!
allyjean,"Dined on August 8, 2016",5,"Casa Mono was outstanding!  Upon arrival, the host let us know that our table wasn't quite ready yet (we were early), but that we could stay for a drink at their sister bar, Bar Jamon, next store.  My boyfriend and I always love to have a cocktail before dinner, so this was just as well!  Not to mention the fact that they had already been extra accommodating when I asked to move my reservation from 8:30 to 7pm.  We had delicious Vermut cocktails in the bar, and since our table ran over, they took care of our drinks for us!  We then began dinner, and because the menu is so delicious, my boyfriend and I were having difficulty deciding what we wanted to eat.  The sommelier was MORE than helpful when deciding which glass of wine we wanted.    And they serve their wines in quartos, so you get a little bit more than a glass full, so you're really able to enjoy your wine!  We wanted to order a few items and then wait to decide on the rest.  And this is why I give the service 4 stars instead of 5.  Our server was annoyed that we wanted to order a few dishes, and then order a few more.  I couldn't tell if it was because he wanted to be able to course our food properly, or if it was because he wanted to turn his table.  But it was a Sunday dinner, and we were buying a lot of food and wine, so I don't think it's right to rush someone.    However, for the rest of the meal, we never felt rushed.  So, I'm assuming maybe he was trying to make sure our food came out properly.  Either way, it was something that irritated me.  That being said, the meal was AMAZING!!! All of the food was delicious and just the right amount!  We had baby squid, razor clams, bone marrow, oxtail, tomatoes, and burrata!  We also had the custard desert, and coffee!  Everything was absolutely fabulous!  And we were VERY full by the end of the meal. After the meal, we loved our wine so much we went next door to bar jamon and had more wine!  What a fabulous meal and experience!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 6, 2016",1,"What a disappointment! DON'T GO  When we walked in the person at the door said we only have 1h 45 min to eat and then we have to leave as next reservation is coming. LIKE WHAT? I go to michelin star restaurants all the time (I do prefer 2 and 3 star ones as I never been disappointed, but decided to give this one star place a try). The place is small and very loud, felt like I am trying to have a dinner at a local college pub. Zero for decor and service!! We wondered how this place can have 1 star, because so far this has been the worst restaurant experience in NYC!! So there was hope for food.. although it had good presentation, most items where WAY to salty. Won't be returning!"

Respecttruehospitality,"Dined on July 19, 2016",4,Always a delight. Never rushed. Wonderful food. Recommended!
Emily,"Dined on July 15, 2016",4,The service is always impeccable and I love the extensive wine list.  My only complaint this time would be the sun's glare through the front windows blinding our server (but he never said anything) and my date.  It was also quite warm inside the restaurant on a hot summer day making it a little uncomfortable.  Some type of pull down shade is really needed.
cl69,"Dined on July 14, 2016",1,Service was very unfriendly.    While we were having dinner  Waiter came about 5 times to clean up the table  . We could not finish  because it became very unpleasant. Same happen with the dessert.
gregg,"Dined on July 10, 2016",4,such a special place! i've been there about 10 times and it never disappoints
rpa619,"Dined on July 8, 2016",3,Food quality and cramped seating doesn't justify the high prices.  Service is mediocre.
Miguel,"Dined on July 6, 2016",4,"Everything was great in terms to food and quality. The only thing not good is that you can get your eyes itchy and red because of the fumes from the kitchen ; so try to seat as far as you can from the kitchen, considering is a small restaurant."
ilbe,"Dined on July 5, 2016",5,"Amazing array of flavors - this is a great place for sharing dishes. Excellent service, the waiters and waitresses were both knowledgeable and attentive. An impressive wine list with lots of great values. A compact place where one is taken care off very well."
reviewer,"Dined on July 4, 2016",1,Awful food. There's no relationship between the food we ate and the wonderful food of Cataluña or any other part of Spain. One can eat better food at a rest stop by a highway in Spain.  Never again.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 3, 2016",5,Casa Mono is a must go place when I travel to NYC. Every friend that I suggest going there thanks me for the  tip.
NenS,"Dined on July 2, 2016",5,Definitely will one back
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 30, 2016",5,"The only restaurant that our family members from overseas insist on visiting when they're in NYC. Consistently outstanding food, friendly and knowledgeable staff, flawless service, perfectly relaxed atmosphere. A late afternoon lunch at Casa Mono is one of life's treasures."
Johnnieye,"Dined on June 28, 2016",5,"I have been to Casa Mono several times and it never fails to exceed expectations.  The menu is adventurous and foodie-approved (if you have non-adventurous eaters in your party, this may not be the place for you).  The dishes are authentically Spanish, bursting with unique flavor combinations.  My only problem is that I have found so many dishes that are ""must order"" (creamy eggs with sea urchin, fried sardines, bacalao croquette, jamon, charcuterie plank, etc.) that it is difficult to explore other things on the menu that look amazing.  They even have a dish that is dedicated to my favorite food writer (heck, favorite writer) Jim Harrison - the lamb tongue.    All in all, one of my favorite casual dining spots in NYC."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 25, 2016",3,Too noisy and too cramped.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 25, 2016",5,"One of my favourites in NY...As always the food were outstanding...We started with the Mono salad followed by scallops with clam , duck egg with truffles , quail with potato pure and a delicious pudin de pan as desert...There is no way to go wrong at this place"
MCNP,"Dined on June 24, 2016",5,"Wonderful service, delicious food, beautiful presentation. We were also very pleasantly surprised how quickly the food came out. The ambience and decor was also very fitting for the cuisine. We will be back!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 22, 2016",4,Deliciosa comida muy bien atendidos! Mucho aire acondicionado lamentablemente como en todos los lugares de usa
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 19, 2016",3,"Every dish we ordered was excellent. My only major complaint--which affected our ability to enjoy our (expensive) meal--was that we were seated in a back, semi-claustrophobic corner with  no AC on a hot NYC day. When we asked about why the AC wasn't on, we were told that it was because the windows were open. The breeze must have been nice for those not tucked away in a corner with no access to open air...  I recommend requesting specific seats in this small restaurant.  ""Not the hot corner"" should suffice."
DreDre,"Dined on June 16, 2016",3,"Unfortunate as I think chef was off.  Everything was very over-oily.  Early in evening and tables did not fill, but we were put on the side with heat from grill wafting over us.  Will probably not return"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 11, 2016",4,"Food tastes great, but on the pricey side for portion sizes. Also a bit cramped. Otherwise a good experience with great service."
LeaS,"Dined on June 10, 2016",5,"Food and wine were amazing!! Be adventurous and try everything. We were 5 and shared the dishes, this allowed us to try almost all the menu."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 6, 2016",4,"The restaurant had a nice ambiance, and the food was very good (sea urchin was a fave).  A bit crammed, but also cosy."
PhyllBird,"Dined on June 4, 2016",4,"Food choices were amazing.  Four of us had 7 plates which was plenty. However, I would suggest more vegetable choices to go along with the awesome meat choices."

Lizzielou,"Dined on May 14, 2016",4,I have always eaten at Casa Mono from the very beginning. I find it to be just perfect and a wonderful place to take out of town friends and family for a very unique dining experience. Service is always perfect and the food is just delicious.. Thank you for being so unique
NeelR,"Dined on May 14, 2016",4,"I've been coming to Casa Mono for years. The food never disappoints. It always seems to be packed, but I like the atmosphere!"
MiguelY,"Dined on May 1, 2016",5,The flavors and aromas at Casa Mona are intense. The preparations are great! The staff knows there wines and help you pair the wine to the food.
Kimmer95,"Dined on April 29, 2016",2,"Food is way too rich for my stomach. Everything is saucey, buttery or oily. Tasty but not worth the stomachache. And a bit too pricey."
KenB,"Dined on April 27, 2016",5,The food is always delicious and even sometimes memorable...like the loose eggs with sea urchin or the cod cheeks pil pil or the bone marrow or the orange infused bread pudding with caramel ice cream 👍👍👍👍👍
Kltten,"Dined on April 26, 2016",5,"The food, service, and ambience was excellent. Small dining room setting. Cozy and comfortable. Not a great option for large groups, but perfect for date night or celebrating a special occasion. Plan to return soon."
JT10022,"Dined on April 22, 2016",5,Everything is awesome here and I love getting a drink at Bar Jamon before dinner. I've been coming here for years and it never gets old.
kuhun,"Dined on April 21, 2016",4,It was little busy when I had dinner. And space is not enough for larger groups. Food was good and server was kind. No restroom in the restaurant.
Alex,"Dined on April 18, 2016",3,"Food was good. Service? Well, if a waiter with a toothpick in his mouth asking you ""How was everything?"" is considered to be a proper serving etiquette in a one Michelin Star restaurant, then service was good, too."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 12, 2016",5,"The food was incredible. We really enjoyed the Creamy eggs with uni and the razor clams. The waitstaff was very attentive, patient, and friendly to our 3 and 5 year old children. We had an early seating and got out just as the restaurant reached full capacity."
Ninalovesfood,"Dined on April 10, 2016",5,"We enjoyed great service and some unique food items: razor clams, uni with soft scrambled eggs, lamb belly, mussels and chorizo, and more.  I could have had everything on the menu.  Our server Fernando was an absolute delight with great food and wine recommendations. High energy spot which was totally booked on a Sunday after 2PM.  Our food and wine arrived quickly and was perfection."

RachelM,"Dined on April 8, 2016",5,The place is tiny and thefoods incredible. Went with friends during a trip to NYC.
jtour,"Dined on April 2, 2016",5,This was my second time here and it was once again excellent.  The rib eye tartar is out of this world.  Every dish was above average and the service was great.  Normally i hate tapas because i feel like i'm always hungry later but this was a filling meal.  Six dishes across two people is more than enough even if both are hungry.
anonymous,"Dined on April 1, 2016",5,"Great innovative food. Each dish a real hit. Noisy, packed,cramped. Real New York."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 31, 2016",4,The food all tastes so good
Aviva,"Dined on March 26, 2016",5,Amazing rib eye tartar. The burrata was top notch.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 26, 2016",5,We could not have been more thrilled with our dinning experience. Saying we were satisfied does not do our experience justice.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 25, 2016",4,"This place is very small but the food they offer is something you can never have in other restaurants. I have tried the cauliflower, mussel, burrata and pork belly, and they all tasted unforgettably good. They come in small plates so you have to expect 2-3 dishes per person though. The service could use some brush up; I didn't see my waiter smile to us nor the tables beside us. But still, I would definitely come back for the irresistible food!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 16, 2016",5,The uni and scrambled eggs with walnuts was my favorite dish of 2016. The razor clams were a study in perfection.  The service was impeccable and the wine was spectacular.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 16, 2016",5,Delicious once again.
flo2lux,"Dined on March 13, 2016",5,"This tiny spanish restaurant surprised me: warm welcome, good service and delicious food!!! Expect high quality and gastro tapas! The wine list of spanish wines is impressive. The only downside is the odor of your clothes when u r leaving :-) this is due to the open kitchen. Anyway I'll get back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 13, 2016",5,This restaurant is consistently excellent.  The food is inventive without being pretentious and the service attentive without hovering.   Everyone I introduce to Casa Mono shares this view.
AndreZ,"Dined on March 5, 2016",3,"Our first experience at Casa Mono (about 4 years ago) was so positive that we decided to go back during this trip (we are from Canada). The food was again very good. Our favorite dish was the Pork croquetas ""Massimo Bottura"".    However, I was seriously disappointed with the pacing of the meal. Our waiter told us that we should order all the plates we want at the same and that the chef would pace the meal. Well, that did not work out well. We were not done with our first plate that our second arrived. I told myself that if the 3rd one arrived as quickly, i would tell the waiter to slow the pace. I did not have the chance to do so since our last 3 plates were served at the same time ! This was very disappointing. This was at 5:00 pm Friday March 5th and half the tables were empty and still were when we left after our meal around 6h30 pm (which we extended by ordering desert and coffee - otherwise we would have been done in less than an hour....)  We ate at Momofuku Ssam Bar  the night before, and we ordered our plates two at a times. The result was a meal properly paced and much better overall experience.  I really enjoyed the food at Casa Mono but I may skip it on my next trip to NYC."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 3, 2016",3,"The food was quite salty, but the service was great! Particularly the sausage and steak were too salty to enjoy."
FoodArchitect,"Dined on February 15, 2016",5,One of our most favorite restaurants in the city....always inspired by the menu and food is absolutely delicious. While it can get crowded and noisy it is worth the squeeze. If only 2 or 3 we would recommend sitting at the food bar and watch the food magic happen!  Wine list is well balanced and offers many great choices and price points.  Can't wait to go back!
Radish,"Dined on February 10, 2016",3,"Menu was full of exciting options: sweetbreads, pigs' ears, rabbit, goat... I found the dishes heavy. For example the sweetbreads, which were fried, were served on top of fennel--which was also oily, and it was served with a Romesco sauce (chopped almonds). The croquetas, which looked like breaded mozzarella sticks, were large and sitting on top of a (to my mind) completely unnecessary thick white sauce. To cut through the unctuousness of the food, several dishes  had an acidic kick. I felt like I was eating my food with a side of vinegar. We had an OK plate of roasted vegetables, the highlight of which was one very tiny eggplant. The other little, round vegetables all looked similar to each other and tasted a lot like potatoes. Lovely dessert of a slice of cake with grapefruit and olive oil ice-cream. Lightest dish of the night. Great wines."
CKUSQ,"Dined on February 8, 2016",4,"My friend and I had delicious quail and Moroccan lamb dishes. They were superb, as was the Mallorcan red wine by the glass. Our experience was at lunch, which accounts for the quiet noise level.  At a previous dinner, the noise level would have to be rated as loud."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 6, 2016",3,"Came here for my birthday, i was really excited when i saw their menu because it seemed exotic and exciting. Honestly, i was a bit disappointment. The food was just okay with the exception of the razor clams - those were amazing. I was especially disappointed about the Foies gras, they overpowered it with some sort of sweet and sour sauce. Foies gras is good by itself, but they just over did it.   The ambiance was okay, the staff was really friendly. The wine list was extensive but i dont think i will be returning."
njlink,"Dined on February 2, 2016",4,"I recently visited Casa Mono, where I hadn't been in several years, for lunch during Restaurant Week. When we arrived at 12:15, it was relatively empty and quiet, but it did fill up within the hour. Although the fried artichokes were delicious and were followed by cockles/pasta-like, I was still hungry because the portions were tiny! The churro and chocolate (thicker than a mousse) was fantastic, too! Maybe it's better this way...you eat less!"
KenB,"Dined on February 1, 2016",5,"The food/small plates...but not too small/ are wonderfully varied and delicious. Everything my wife and I ate, and we ate a lot, was scrumptious. We will certainly go back very soon and many more times."
JROSE,"Dined on January 30, 2016",3,Staff was barely friendly enough for the service not to be bad but the vibe was very off putting and cold. Seating is uncomfortable and they don't do anything extra to make it good enough to recommend or go back.
dancer,"Dined on January 29, 2016",2,It's a small place.  The table where we sat in the corner was in very tight quarters.  The portions were small but adequate for lunch.
AnnH,"Dined on January 20, 2016",5,"We enjoyed our restaurant week lunch thoroughly.  The food was delicious, service very good.  I plan to return w/friends for another lunch very soon."
susanjo,"Dined on January 18, 2016",5,We returned to Casa Mono for dinner after a performance at Classic Stage Company on E 13th St and it was as wonderful as ever. This time we were a party of 4 which enabled us to taste more dishes which was great. Some items on the menu are pretty constant - have to have the razor clams- and some change which is great. The wine list is extensive and there are excellent options on the lower end of the price scale. Casa Mono never disappoints but it is small so reservations if you want a table are a must!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 17, 2016",3,"No wonder they are well qualified in the Zagat and Michelin guides, you feel the vibe of a real tapas place in Barcelona. The menu is bold, a it has what you really need in a tapas BAR/ Restaurant. Just don´t expect friendly personnel , being said that you can really feel in Barcelona."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 17, 2016",5,Great great great always great
CarolW,"Dined on January 14, 2016",4,Loved the uni and egg - and the vanilla pudding dessert. Really enjoyed the blending of flavors in all my tapas.
Lloyd,"Dined on January 13, 2016",3,"yummy food, but really not a good business lunch place, VERY small portions, small dish sharing kind of thing which is fine when you're with friends. we left hungry and it is pricey."
DosCompadres,"Dined on January 13, 2016",5,"The food was really different, delicious, and well prepared. We had 7 different dishes and loved them all. The sommelier picked us a wonderful wine in our price range that really complimented the food. A thoroughly enjoyable experience. We will go again when we return to NY."
Riribear1006,"Dined on January 11, 2016",4,"I have been to Casa Mono 4 different occasions and the food never disappoint.  When you go to the same restaurant more than 3 times and the quality remains superb, you know you've got a gem on your hands. The ingredients of every single dish is well thought out and the flavoring  is nothing short of amazing."
GazNYC,"Dined on January 9, 2016",5,"I could go every day and not get tired of it, menu is mind boggling-ly large for such a small kitchen & everything comes out perfect every time. I'm counting the days until my next visit."
TAPASnWINE,"Dined on January 8, 2016",5,"Table of four, two couples, a waiter that was all about excellent service, wine suggestion, plate advice, and a wonderful setting to get out and just have time to get to know new friends.  CASA MONO is a treasure.  Highly recommended.  Will go again."
Michelle,"Dined on January 7, 2016",5,"Had a fantastic meal at Casa Mono as always. For such a tiny restaurant, you really get outstanding food and first rate service. It's truly deserving of its Michelin star."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 31, 2015",4,Delicious foods! Especially Razor clams and foie gras!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 28, 2015",4,"Great ambiance set us up for a terrific evening. The wine list was excellent, as was the advice to get through it. We enjoyed a delicious 2005 Rioja. The food choices were excellent, but stand out dishes were the oxtail stuffed peppers and the seared foie gras."
Bianca,"Dined on December 25, 2015",4,"Food is great, but if you can get service.  We were thee at Christmas Eve, which made it easier to reserve.  The sommelier was fantastic and very friendly, which unfortunately I cannot say for the service, which was inattentive and not exactly friendly I should say.  So we ended up asking our questions to the sommelier and he also helped out with the food service which he did not have to.  We would go again but management has to really check on the service."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2015",1,Experience was very bad. It started with a very poor interaction with the hostess. They gave us a poor table even though two superior tables of the same size were open the entire time we were there. The hostess have us a time limit to finish our meal!!!! Service was among top 5 worst service and on top of that food was mediocre and not a good value for money
fvaccari,"Dined on December 19, 2015",3,"Food was amazing. unique dishes, large portion sizes. The service however was disappointing. We had many waiters ask us the same questions (two asked for our drink orders, same waiter asked us twice if we wanted coffee after we had already received the coffee),  we ordered 5 dishes and they only brought 3 out."
Reviewer,"Dined on December 16, 2015",4,"Large, creative menu.  Well executed by the kitchen.  Service prompt.  Wine list is the broadest selection of Spanish wines I can recall. However, the place is tiny and cramped.  Hope they can move to a bigger space."
Piner,"Dined on December 15, 2015",5,"Very affordable dinner for Michelin quality dining. Food was fun, wine list is fun, ambience is casual and inviting."
MD121490,"Dined on December 15, 2015",4,"The menu is great, with a wide variety of fairly exotic selections (although not so exotic as to be inaccessible to most).  If you're not a particularly knowledgeable foodie, you'll find the menu refreshingly new.  If you are more on the experienced end, you'll still find some new fare that you may not have seen elsewhere in a while.   Wine menu is solid; good selection.  Not the most groundbreaking selection I've seen, but certainly more on the developed end.   The service can be characterized as...attentive, but not overly invasive.  And when you're on a date, I think this is ideal.    Lastly, the space is pretty small/packed in.  You won't be on top of other people, but you also won't find yourself with a ton of space.  Fully expect your neighbors to be able to eavesdrop on your conversation with ease, if they wanted to."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 14, 2015",5,"I had been craving tapas for some time now and this restaurant hit the spot.  The food was very flavorful and savory, just how I like it."
Brian,"Dined on December 12, 2015",4,"We had late night reservation (11.15pm), and it felt like we were rushed a bit by the kitchen pushing out dishes. I didn't bother us too much, as I figured this might happen ahead of time.   Most of the dishes were absolutely incredible.  Dorado, steak and one lamb dish in particular were incredible.  I'd give pass on patatas bravas if returning. Not very good really.  Great wine list of course, and friendly, helpful servers.  A very down to earth experience for being such an acclaimed restaurant."
Mar2014,"Dined on December 12, 2015",5,"I have been living in NYC for a couple of years, I´m a foodie and I´m hard to please. This place is one of the best restaurants I´ve been in NYC. The octopus, the ham, the rabbit, the fideos, the duck and the wine were great, really, it is a must!"
susanjo,"Dined on December 11, 2015",5,This was my 5th visit to Casa Mono and it never disappoints! It is indeed very small which is part of the charm and it can get noisy but they also have tables for 2 tucked away by the window that helps with the noise.  The variety of small plates changes regularly so never tire of going there!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 5, 2015",3,I found a lot of the dishes hit or miss.
Martha,"Dined on December 1, 2015",5,"We went early, before a film, so noise level may be higher later in the evening. However, food was excellent as well as ambiance. Very small restaurant!"
Sabsy89,"Dined on November 26, 2015",3,"Wasn't as great as I expected, and I was really looking forward to this place. The service was pretty low for a Michelin star place. No one smiled and it took forever to get the waiter's attention (enough this there are only 10 tables in the restaurant). Food was a bit salty, but still innovative and well made."
PattyS,"Dined on November 22, 2015",4,Casa Mono continues to amaze me with the delicious and variety of tapas.  Amazing wine list to match and staff exceptional.  No wonder its hard to get dinner reservations.  But worth it.
DanielW,"Dined on November 22, 2015",5,"Casa Mono was fantastic both times I visited. The small plates are all delicious, and the menu changes often enough that you don't get bored. The serving staff do a great job of pacing the meal as well. The slight downside is how small it is, but I love Casa Mono just the way it is."
WouldJohnEatIt,"Dined on November 20, 2015",5,"Every item which we ordered was something exotic and very tasty.  My favorite was the quail.  Members of my party enjoyed the Lamb and Goat dishes a lot.  I enjoyed the mussels - especially the broth.  We ordered about 60% of the menu and everything was great, I recommend trying something you have never tried before and you will not be disappointed.  We didn't try the pig ears though, I guess that will be for next time."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 19, 2015",5,Spectacular lunch at what has now become an NYC classic. Thank you.
ebwp,"Dined on November 17, 2015",5,Every dish we tried was delicious.  Very tight quarters is the only detracting characteristic but everything else about the restaurant was superb.  Can't wait to go back!
Xfw50,"Dined on November 17, 2015",5,Always a delight to dine here. The mixtures of  different flavours that they manage to include in the changing menu never fails to take me by surprise.
susanjo,"Dined on November 15, 2015",5,Always a pleasure to dine at Casa Mono if you love variety and small plates to share.  Wonderful wine list and very knowledgeable staff. Only disappointment was the squid dish that was too heavy on the batter so lost the taste of the squid but the other dishes were great.
Cowhoma,"Dined on November 14, 2015",5,"Dinner was wonderful with a large array of tastes and textures. Four of us ate the roast iberico pig, the stuffed lamb belly, the soft scrambled eggs, the potato croquettes, the Mexican meatballs, the Brussel sprouts, and several other small plates. We oohed and aahed at each new taste. Our waiter was warm and helpful. The only minus was the noise level. These are the best tapas I have had outside of San Sebastián."
Parent19,"Dined on November 14, 2015",3,"Our experience at Casa Mono was a good one.  My wife and I felt that the servers were attentive.  For a quiet place with music in the background, we almost wished the volume was just a little louder, but that's not a big deal.  The lighting was nice and low enough, but bright enough to really see what was happening.    The menu was unique and had many options.  We had the Dorado, which was good, but not great.  The baby squid wasn't too bad either, but not great.  We finally tried the bone marrow.  We didn't know what to expect, but overall, it was new and exciting.  I might not order that again, but I was glad we had it there to try.  The rabbit was fantastic!  Man was that good.  We would come back again to try some of the other options.  Nice little place."

FoodieNJ,"Dined on November 12, 2015",4,"Having been a fan of Mario Batali, my partner and I have been wanting to visit this restaurant for quite a while.  After finally getting some prized reservations, we made it in and a very nice corner table was provided for us.  The place is small and very tight but they were incredibly accommodating to us consider we're both big guys.  We began to order food and it started coming in like the wind.  Our waitress was on point, quick and very detail oriented without being over bearing.  The Razor Clams, Manchego Salad, Fideos, Sweetbreads, Octopus, Sardines... I could keep going - trust me - it was an awesome meal!!!   Every dish better than the next.. the place is loud and tight, but fun and it's all about being with friends, having fun, enjoying your food and your company.  Book a reservation now - you won't regret a second of it!"
BobR,"Dined on November 12, 2015",5,This is a fantastic restaurant. The only thing I would recommend is to ease up with n the salt. Food was delicious and artfully presented.
CSRNYC,"Dined on November 12, 2015",5,"My friend and I shared 5 tapas dishes (clams, jamon, lamb confit, hen of the wood mushrooms, one more) and a dessert (bread pudding).  Everything was superb.  He especially enjoyed the wine."
KellyRT,"Dined on November 10, 2015",4,"I went to Casa Mono with my boyfriend for his 30th birthday. Our server was fantastic and made very good recommendations regarding the food, and the sommelier recommended a great, bottle of wine as well as two dessert wines at the end of the meal. My boyfriend and I both thought each dish we ordered was excellent, and we had a fantastic dining experience until the end.   The restaurant is very small and the tables close together which is understandable for the neighborhood, but one of the restaurant staff was surprisingly rude in pushing my chair in and telling me I needed to move in so he could get through.    Then immediately after we paid the bill, but while we were still finishing our desert and desert drinks, the host came and said they had another reservation and that they needed us to finish up at the bar. It sounds like something small, but it really impacted our experience and turned us off from the restaurant. When we spent as much money as we did on the meal, we expected to at least be able to finish the end of the meal without being booted from our table. But it seemed like the moment we paid, they no longer cared about the experience we were having. There are just so many restaurants in NYC where you can get excellent food AND excellent service for that much money to deal with that. It would be one thing if we were lingering over our water for a half an hour, but we hadn't even finished the meal when they told us they needed us out of our table. Also, there was a 2-3 person table in a better location in the restaurant that had been empty all night and was empty when they asked us to move, so I'm not sure why they didn't seat us in the other table from the start if they thought reservations might run into each other. So unfortunately despite having a really great experience with our waiter and really enjoying the food, we won't be going back to the restaurant because of how the meal ended."
KatNDSpain,"Dined on November 8, 2015",5,"This was a great meal for a birthday dinner with a group of 6. I frequent Spanish restaurants in the city, but hadn't been back to Casa Mono in a long time (partly due to living near several other great Spanish options). The food was outstanding, and with 6 of us, we were able to try lots of things. Dessert and wine were also fantastic!"
Panamadave,"Dined on November 7, 2015",2,"This was our second trip to New York in 4 years and we booked Casa Mona as our culinary treat - we live in France and have also lived in Spain for many years and have eaten dozens of Michelin Starred meals over the years. On this occasion it was no where near Michelin Starred standard, in fact our last  one star Michelin meal was on the Northern Costa Brava a month ago which was fantastic and in a different league to this.    The restaurant is small and informal - which we love having eaten in many such settings in Spain, France and the UK- but why the loud music, surely its not necessary in a lively,  busy upscale restaurant which creates its own buzz. However this is a minor point, the food was way over salted, lacked subtlety and refinement and was way below the standard we have experienced for a one star restaurant.   On our last trip to NYC we ate at Aldea another Michelin one star restaurant not far from Casa Mona and this was every bit as good as our European experiences, so this is not a Europe v USA debate.  On the upside the staff where attentive and polite - although we had to ask for one of the dishes to be explained to us- and the wine was well selected and very reasonably priced. However, this does not make up for the real disappointment of the food, this should have been one of the highlight of our holiday and its only succeeded in leaving a really bad impression. Michelin judges what are you doing?"
Maja,"Dined on November 4, 2015",5,"We loved everything here, didn't even mind that the tables were so close together. The tapas were indeed phenomenal, and the service was even better!"
Alyoops,"Dined on November 4, 2015",4,Cases Mono is delightfully small with attentive service and excellent tapas. Each dish is carefully constructed and full of flavor. We had scallops with tiny apple slices. Simple and refreshing. Pork croquetta - yum - roasted vegetables with a beautiful sauce and flavorful minced lamb. Only criticism: very tight seating and frequently getting knocked about by servers. But it was worth it.
Juju,"Dined on November 3, 2015",3,"My friend and I were stuck in the table right next to the entrance.  Waiter service during the beginning of the meal was good.  Near the end of the meal when we had 2-3 bites left of our food and half our wine glasses still filled, we were asked about 2 times if we were done (despite seeing us STILL eating).  After the second time, we felt we were being hurried out of there so we took the hint and literally just stuffed whatever was left on the dish in our mouths and finished the wine.  As we were doing this, we were told we had to get out of our seats in 5 minutes because there was another group that reserved the table.  Now, I understand that this restaurant is popular and have reservations back to back, but come on.  I'm a relatively quick eater and have never been told to get out asap....Food was salty--maybe biased by my lackluster dining experience here.  Disappointed having heard good things about this restaurant from my friends and colleagues.  Probably won't be back...for awhile at least."
Native,"Dined on October 29, 2015",1,"We were 3 and seated at a table for 2, it was late lunch and the place wasn't crowded.  The server was surly and unhelpful.  We ordered 3 things to share and barely got any food.  The prices are outrageous for the amount of food you get and the atmosphere and service is horrific.  I saw that if you were ""known"" here you got a completely different experience.  BOOOOO."
ffranny,"Dined on October 28, 2015",4,"The food was great, but if the waiter takes pains to describe the dishes as ""meant for sharing,"" then *please* plate them so two people at a small table in a small restaurant can divide them easily without surgical instruments and advanced gymnastics."
IngaO,"Dined on October 24, 2015",2,Dishes were hit or miss. Very cramped and loud. They only serve wine and beer. No full bar.
DeliaG,"Dined on October 24, 2015",4,"We have been to Casa Mono many of times. Our waiter was excellent. On this occasion we had a friend from Japan joining. At one point he was trying to catch the attention of a waiter that was not our waiter. I do admit that he was being loud about, but that is what he is used to. When the other waiter came over my husband said...please pardon my friend. He replied..yes, he is being rude. We were very disappointed by his sarcastic comment. A restaurant in NYC should be more culturally aware of its clients and when we actually made a statement, he should not have been the sarcastic rude waiter.  Next time we go to Casa Mono we will make sure to get Brian and not sarcastic Rude waiter."
Feedmegood,"Dined on October 24, 2015",1,Every dish seems to be too salty. Do not like most of the combination of the taste.
Frank,"Dined on October 22, 2015",2,"Overrated. Ok tapas, had much better. good wine program. Table too squished on top of each other. Everyone gets bumped reoeatedly.Not sure who paid off Michelin to get six year's worth of a one star. Maybe a Bib no way a star."
Hatetocook,"Dined on October 20, 2015",4,"We went to this restaurant for a friends birthday.  I reserved on open table and was given a choice of either 4:45 or 9:00.  During our dinner the restaurant was virtually empty so it seemed strange that we couldn't get a later time.  The staff was wonderful and explained everything and answered our many questions,  We all ordered different things so we could taste as many things as possible.  My one and only complaint is the wine.  There is a very extensive list that none of us understood.  With the help of the waiter, we were all satisfied with our selections.  The wine was served in a Cuorto or something like that.  It was supposed to be a glass and a half.  It was barely a glass.  50% of our bill was the wine.  Since we were not familiar with the wine, we had no idea how overcharged we were.  But certainly the food was delicious, just with I could bring my own wine!"
Rado,"Dined on October 18, 2015",5,"Having heard about Casa Mono for so long and never having been before, was delighted with the variety and the delicious productions from the kitchen.  Can't wait to go back and explore other tempting dishes. I guess the one down side is that being small it is quite noisy, but makes up in flavor!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 15, 2015",5,Amazing food at a reasonable price. Not too busy at lunchtime either. Should definitely be on everyone's short list of go-to places.
CaliforniaDiner,"Dined on October 15, 2015",5,"Delicate Tapas flavors, exquisite. Need to upgrade their tables and chairs"
Fluffernutter,"Dined on October 15, 2015",4,"We shared everything- started w fideo w chorizo and clams, skirt steak w romesco and onion marmalade. Both were good. Following those, we had the goat confit (absurdly tender but a teensy bland) and the stuffed, braised lamb belly w mint and kohlrabi salad (AMAZING). We weren't drinking, the bill was 97$. Well worth it for a quiet, leisurely and delicious lunch."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 14, 2015",2,"I used to love this restaurant. But I don't think I will go back there after tonight.  After several visits here, I decided to bring my coworkers to treat them as I had been satisfied. It was 4 people and we ordered 6 items with a bottle of wine. My co worker found one small piece of black rubber from Pulpo. I let server know about it. He took the dish and did not come back to ask to have same item or different item from the menu. He just disappeared.  I found a piece of hard shell from pig ears appetizer right after we complained. At this point, I did not want to embarrass anyone and ruined dinner so I shut my mouth up.  Mussels and lamb belly were not great. Mussels were too salty and lamb belly was so greasy. Skirt steak was great and that's the only one recommendation among 6 dishes we ordered.   Service was attentive though. One star for him."
Saek,"Dined on October 11, 2015",5,"To have a meal that doesn't fail in any way simply doesn't happen enough.  The wine list was a book in itself and it was superior to many places that cost more.  Pan con Tomate, Ensalada Mono, Dorado, Steak, Potatoes and Mushroom are cooked to bring out incredible flavor. The Crema Catalan just brought back Barcelona."
annabelle,"Dined on October 6, 2015",3,"I've always enjoyed the food here, but don't expect a friendly server or good hospitality."
Frenchie,"Dined on October 6, 2015",5,Great romantic NYC dinner!  Delicious plates to share and wonderful wine list.  Definitely well worth it!
AdamC,"Dined on October 3, 2015",5,"Better than ever. Service, food, wine service... Everything was impeccable. One of my favorite dining experiences of 2015."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 3, 2015",5,The waiter recommended great dishes and wine.  He was right.
TheBlacklist,"Dined on September 30, 2015",5,"The meal and the service were both excellent, as always. The level of excellence is incredibly consistent that I could easily copy and paste my reviews from prior experiences and it would still be spot on. This is also the reason I enjoy purchasing Casa Mono GCs as I feel comfortable and confident that the recipient will have an equally enjoyable dining experience."
PBfoodie,"Dined on September 28, 2015",5,We had a stellar evening at Casa Mona! The reservation is hard to get and typical not on the ideal date or best time but it's worth it! A 10!
Jazzfid,"Dined on September 26, 2015",5,"Superb. Loved it five years ago but even better now.  We had Sepia, Pork Belly and Lamb.  Quality of the meat and fish was superb. Preparation was imaginative, seasoning distinctive. The bread pudding was transcendent."
dalb,"Dined on September 23, 2015",1,"We had a really disappointing experience last night at casa mono. Overall, very pricy, 100$ per head with 1 glass of wine and 1 beer; food is good, not all the dishes have equal quality but overall food is fine. Portions are fairly small, but I guess this is the tapas style. We were squeezed on one small table sharing it with three other people and asked to move to an other table with more room, but the manager told us this is not the policy of the restaurant (???!?!?) that table was empty for 1 hour BTW. An other of this over rated NY restaurant which might have been nice once but lost all it's candor being popular."
Orlando94,"Dined on September 21, 2015",5,"We really enjoy our visit to Casal Mono! The food, the service, the ambiance, the attention to detail from The General Manager, Miguel de Leon, the servers, everything.  The best mussels and croquettes! Obviously, we loved it! Great experience."
Panoh,"Dined on September 20, 2015",5,The Spanish inspired cuisine was wonderful and varied. Our server was very knowledgable and attentive.
NewYorkFoodie,"Dined on September 19, 2015",2,"Pervasive over salted ruined the food. What might have been great skirt steak, was overwhelmed with salt. Great fideos - very salty sea beans. Fish - salty sauce. When I told the waiter the food was overly salted he thanked me. Everything we ordered seemed to also have an abundance of onions, which we did not appreciate with the undercooked patatas bravas. I understand trying to elevate a classic using fingerlings, but the dish did not work. The only really good dish was the fideos, and if not for that, we would have left hungry. Noisy with uncomfortable chairs,  and overpriced small portions - we will not return."
Crystal,"Dined on September 19, 2015",4,Great service and we really enjoyed some of the dishes. Others were bland like the one chorizo dish. The lamb was amazing and so was the olive oil served with the meal. Pork belly dish was tasty as well.
NJlovesNYC,"Dined on September 16, 2015",4,"We loved this restaurant.  Tables for 2 limited, so in a corner.  Would opt for bar stools (offered) next time.  Everything was delicious and interesting.  Will be back to try other dishes and wine!"
SRadjy,"Dined on September 13, 2015",4,"A few people in our group were a bit skeptical about menu items as they had unexpected combinations of ingredients but everything we had was absolutely delicious, with original and subtle pairings creating a really wonderful dining experience. Some favorites were the eggplant escabeche, leg of lamb with mushrooms, mussels with chorizo and cava, skirt steak, and burrata (I am sure I am forgetting a few). In addition the smaller plates make it perfect for sharing, and for trying more dishes than you could ever enjoy otherwise! Service was a little less adaptable/flexible/casual than ideal but still pleasant. We will definitely be back."
Nick12,"Dined on September 7, 2015",5,"Everything on the menu sounded great so it took a few minutes just to narrow down our choices.  My date and I split 5 dishes, 1 glass of white wine with our seafood dishes, 1 glass of red wine with our meat dishes and a dessert.  Every dish was amazing.  We had mussels in an amazing sauce, the grilled baby octopus over fennel, quail with smoked peppers, oxtail stuffed piquillo peppers, and the pork belly.  I would love to go back and try new things but it would be hard to not get some of these dishes again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 31, 2015",5,Allways a great experience. The food and wine are over the top good. Fun if you can eat at the bar and eneract with Chiefs...
MermaidMagicDines,"Dined on August 27, 2015",2,"Food has gone way downhill. Sardines tasted way too fishy.  I love sardines and have eaten them here before and these were horrible today.   Sepia was overcooked and chewy.  Sent it back. Octopus was so tiny basically about an inch.  Once they were grilled and sent atop a cold fennel salad they tasted like fennel.  No taste and not crispy grilled, just seared and served over a cold salad.  Tasteless. Sunflower Salad was different but braising sunflowers in red wine gave them too much tannin, and made your mouth scratchy. We went to casa  mono for their amazing razor clams, they were out!  This place is not half of what it used to be. Sad to see one of my favorite restaurants lose what they built their name on: great tapas!!! Not here any longer"
daviboi,"Dined on August 25, 2015",4,"Though our table couldn't have been wedged in more closely, once the food began to arrive who could have cared?  In particular, the razor clams rocked my world - go as soon as you can, and as often."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 25, 2015",4,"Restaurant is cozy and intimate - smaller and a bit on the noisy side, but adds to the energy!  The black ham is amazing!"
LaFleur,"Dined on August 23, 2015",4,"We love Casa Mono. Especially sitting at the bar. Everything there is delicious. But if they have the razor clams, order as many as they will sell you. They are an herby and garlicky treat that should not be missed."
KNYC,"Dined on August 20, 2015",5,"I like this little place a lot. Great for a long lunch. Excellent service & ambiance. Small tables mostly for 2, but the tapas is brought  2-3 plates at a time so the table never seems overcrowded. A well conceived and thorough Spanish wine list with lots of choices at every price. Order the razor clams even if they're not on the menu...they usually have them. Scallops & foie gras also terrific."
Wolff,"Dined on August 20, 2015",5,Fantastic food and great ambiance. We'll definitely be back.
Glory,"Dined on August 15, 2015",4,They opened their doors late but once they did we were seated and our order taken immediately.  Our first server didn't seem to know what was going on very much but later on - someone else arrived who was much more friendly and could explain the menu. There are NO cocktails here - just wine.    The food is SUPERB so you overlook the other flaws because its so yummy.
Jenny,"Dined on August 15, 2015",5,"Firstly the small plates aren't that small. Two of us ordered 4 plates to share and we couldn't finish. We had the special dish for the night - quail which is so delicious, grilled dorado was also very nice, bone marrow was super large dish and was ok.. And the rabbit - all of the meat was used including liver and kidney, which was also ok. We would come back for the quail and dorado."

aJadedNewYorker,"Dined on August 13, 2015",2,"Is a bad joke, mini portion, don't participate I you can't serve regular portion with some garnish"
Jess,"Dined on August 10, 2015",2,"Very disappointed. The space is too small and the food is not as good as Michelin star food should be. The ensalada is good. The oxtail is very salty and burned. The desert is also badly made, not even as good as I can make. The service is also not good. Nobody came to fill my water when it is completely empty. I would not recommend the restaurant week menu to anybody. Maybe the normal dishes are good. But for the restaurant week, Casa Mono should make a little more effort to please its customers."
Tommy,"Dined on August 10, 2015",4,"Actually the food is pretty good, the environment is not bad too. I like the restaurant a lot because it is quiet and people can talk to each other rather than too louder. The service is very good too because the waiter will keep check back to our table to make sure our food is good or not. Overall, only one thing i don't like it from this restaurant is the food is too oily.  But i still recommend my friend to come try it"
teach29,"Dined on August 8, 2015",5,"Vibrant ambiance, great food and service."
Jessica,"Dined on August 7, 2015",5,"My partner and I took two other couples to Casa Mono, one of our favorites in the city, for dinner and everyone raved afterwards about how wonderful the food was and how much they enjoyed the restaurant. I come here regularly and have never had a dish that I didn't like. The service is always fabulous, and I will definitely keep coming back for more."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 4, 2015",5,"this was a wonderful dinner. Everything from the choices of dishes, the service, the wine list, the ambience. And most of all the food was terrific. Sorry I had never been here before, but will certainly be here again!!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 1, 2015",3,"expensive expensive expensive!!! The important thing need to repeat three times.we ordered the restaurant week but were unable to use.

JeffM,"Dined on July 24, 2015",5,"About a month ago, we took a class at the Institute of Culinary Education ""Classic Dishes fro Casa Mono"" taught be Andy Sasso - head chef at Casa Mono.  We loved the class and wanted to check it out.  Tiny place, but to start with -service was friendly attentive and knowledgable.  Between us we had 6 plates - oysters, baby squid, cod croquettes, potatoes bravado, pork meatballs with clams, and pork belly.  Food was delicious, beatifully presented, and the serving size was perfect.    We will return soon."
Extremens,"Dined on July 21, 2015",2,Charcuterie plate was good; everything else overpriced and salty.
Fooder,"Dined on July 18, 2015",4,"The food is very well made and the service professional. Wine list is thorough and well chosen, but coravin white wines are served by the glass  at cellar temperature (in other words, not at the correct one). However, the only relevant nit is a certain odor of fry produced by the kitchen, which is not perfectly neutralized by the exhauster. Not the most inspiring thing to experience in a restaurant."
kmrebello,"Dined on July 14, 2015",4,"Great ambiance, very small space but you immediately feel at home in Casa Mono. Interesting dishes and wine selection, we couldn't get enough. Our new favorite spot. Try the razor clams and the pulpo!"
Delightful,"Dined on July 11, 2015",2,"Delightful, as usual, especially for nonNYC friends!"
amblouin,"Dined on July 5, 2015",5,"Great find recommended by a chef friend. The service is impeccable, the wine list is just wow (lost of private imports from Spain so talking to the sommelier is a good idea) and the food was truly outstanding. From the olive oil and bread to set the table to the rabbit, pork belly, oyster mushrooms, clam and pork dish, charcuteries, patatas bravas and so on and so forth."
Martha,"Dined on July 4, 2015",4,Came here the first time on a double date. The food was good but be prepared that the menu is modern fusion. Portion is also slightly larger than a typical serving size. Our favorite is the pig ear.
MJ1203,"Dined on June 23, 2015",5,"Unique small plates of Spanish gourmet foods in a very small, energetic space. Delicious wine and fantastic service!"
Boo13,"Dined on June 21, 2015",1,"We drove in from  CT for a Fathers Day lunch. They seated our party of three at a table for two pushed up against another table for two with three people. We asked to sit where two tables were put together more comfortably but were told they were reserved.  Everyone who walked by bumped into our chairs. Service was rushed. We were out of there in under forty minutes and, by the way, no one ever sat at the two empty tables we asked to move to. Temperature in the eighties outside but no air conditioning. The food was decent but we will never go back."
LeeA,"Dined on June 19, 2015",5,"We had a group of five (5) for this past Friday lunch and it was perfect! I knew that going into this that the restaurant is intimate in size, but it ended up being just the right amount of intimacy as the food selection an plate ingredients sparked animated conversation. As I was the host, I solicited suggestions from the group as to what they wanted/didn't want and went from there. Service and pace of the dishes coming out was great and overall, could not have done anything different to make this lunch better. Would definitely go back again!"
Lichi83,"Dined on June 17, 2015",4,"Food was good, wine was excellent. great service and nice bar area next door. Pricy."
Nina,"Dined on June 12, 2015",3,Don't miss the scallops and the pork belly plates - they are delicious. The place is smallish though. We arrived just a tad bit before the opening time but we were allowed only at the exact opening time. Try also their churros chocolate.
DPaul,"Dined on June 8, 2015",5,One of the closest places to feel like eating in Spain.  It is outstanding. Every single dish was so good and no need of complex ingredients. It is a most!
Eateat,"Dined on June 5, 2015",5,"I didn't have one dish I did not enjoy! The flavors were surprising and original. We had a hard time  picking which dish was the best. The sauces on the clam razors , mussels and calamari were each outstanding! (Wish I could bottle each of them and serve over pasta!) The service was excellent, attentive but not overbearing! Just an excellent experience!"
Douglas,"Dined on June 1, 2015",5,"We live in the Flatiron, and Casa Mono has never disappointed. We treated friends from Montreal the other night (they and their city are very into food) and they loved it. The dishes were varied and uniformly excellent (the lamb belly, the crispy pigs ears, the bone marrow, the sardines, the jamon Iberico to start . . . ). Our server was professional, informative, friendly and our sommelier came up with a great wine recommendation. In fact, he checked the wine before pouring it - if was off - and apologized that our jamon Iberico would now arrive a few minutes earlier than the wine while he went searching for a replacment. That's service self-awareness at its best.  Every visit makes us want to go back for more!"
YummyFoodForager,"Dined on May 31, 2015",4,"We got the razor clams (not on menu, had to be requested), skirt steak,  oxtail stuffed peppers, and soft shelled crab. My husband still cannot stop raving about the razor clams, which we've only had previously in Spain. My favorite was the skirt steak and the remoulade that came with it, even though I normally am not big on beef. It was very tasty!  The service could have been better. Our server seemed to be annoyed that we asked about the razor clams, because we'd heard about them from a friend, yet it was not on the menu. He said it was a special, yet we were never told the specials. He also managed to hit his foot on my chair every time he walked by, possibly due to there being very little space in the restaurant. However, he became nicer towards the end of the meal, when we got the absolutely delicious olive oil ice cream. All the other staff seemed extremely nice.  While my husband would love to visit again asap, I thought Casa Mono was good restaurant to bring back memories of Spain, but there are many other restaurants to try also."
PeteNYC,"Dined on May 28, 2015",5,"Great food, Great atmosphere, perfect for celebrations.  Not a big place, good for groups of 4 or less, mostly tables for two.  The octopus and bone marrow were out of this world.  Highly Recommend.  Also, very extensive wine list."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 26, 2015",5,"Each time I go here the food gets better. Try the new piquillo stuffed with oxtail it is not to be missed. Wine list is by far the best Spanish list in the city, perhaps the country."
Pinkie,"Dined on May 25, 2015",4,The food and wine @ Casa Mono has never disappointed. Service is patchy at best - have had great waiters but gee it's a drag when you know more than they do - and they don't get it! Oh young people these days ...so be guided by your palate  in choosing the food combos and  stay with the carafes.  Not for novices but  if artichoke octupus and goat appeal you are in for a treat😋
KristinaM,"Dined on May 18, 2015",5,"As always, fantastic food. I go to Casa Mono every time I come to NY"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 18, 2015",5,"Perfect tapas restaurant  as a gift for Mom's birthday. We both enjoyed the open eatery feel; much like a small Parisian cafe. The food was outstanding, creative and an absolute delight. Staff was pleasant and prompt in their service. Would certainly recommend for any and all persons to enjoy."

DrDan,"Dined on April 30, 2015",5,Every detail counts in presentation and assembly of  each dish. Superb!
CityChick,"Dined on April 28, 2015",4,"Came here to celebrate my husbands birthday on a Monday night. The restaurant was full. Very nice interior cozy, open kitchen, good for a work dinner but also romantic enough for a couples dinner. We ordered five plates off the entire menu and were quit full at the end of the night. Our waiter was very knowledgable and recommended the most popular dishes to us.  The creamy eggs with sea urchin and oxtail stuffed peppers were two of my favorites. Overall our experience was very pleasant, good food, good atmosphere and pleasant staff."
eattting,"Dined on April 21, 2015",5,"The razor clams, the quail and the lamb with chocolate sauce especially. Good wine list too."
RediscoveringNYC,"Dined on April 17, 2015",5,"What a great find! How did I live in NYC for so many years and nor know about this place? The tapas were so creative and tasty. So much better than all the generic tapas places I've eaten at all my life, in the U.S. and Spain. The clams are a must eat!!!"
LoveIt,"Dined on April 12, 2015",5,"We sat at the bar instead of a table by choice, because it gave us a front seat view of open kitchen, which was really fun and added a lot to the experience. Food was crazy delicious."
Thelesis,"Dined on April 11, 2015",4,"Eggs with sea urchin, walnut and lime zest were silky, indulgent and delicious, interesting contrasts in flavor and texture.  The fideos with chorizo and clams didn't hold up to my memory -- skimpy on the clams and the fideos were mushy.  Pimentos stuffed with oxtail were good, pretty much exactly as one would imagine them.  The rabbit with habanero sauce was a standout.  All the different portions of rabbit were cooked to perfection, the habanero sauce had a mellow, fruity heat and the house-made kimchee provided a bright note of acid to offset the richness of the rabbit."
Joey,"Dined on April 10, 2015",5,"I guarantee if you take the dishes recommended then you won't regret it! We couldn't believe how much flavour was in each dish. We were also very impressed by the wine list and recommendations given for the wine.  We have travelled extensively around Spain and the knowledge of the Sommelier was really impressive.  The only wish would be that I had enough room to taste the whole menu here.  This restaurant would easily be one of my all time favourites ever! Thank you Casa Mono, it was sensational!"
Steve,"Dined on April 9, 2015",5,"Absolutely phenomenal tapas restaurant. Though a tad pricey, you are getting high quality authentic Spanish cuisine. Definitely a romantic spot for a date. I don't recommend going with a group larger than 4 as seating is close and sometimes limited. Watching the chefs prepare the dishes is a real treat as their motions are fluid and professional. They're also ready and willing to have a conversation or to answer any questions you have with the food. I recommend starting with the buffalo milk burrata."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 7, 2015",5,Casa Mono is my favorite restaurant in NYC. The wine list is amazing and incredibly unique. The food is extraordinary. Sit at the bar where you can watch the chefs cook in front of you.
aolaw,"Dined on April 6, 2015",3,"Something is wrong from the last several times I dined here.  The fideos with clam dish wasn't prepared with care.  The dish was not run under the salamander to crisp up the fideos, the fideos were just thrown together with the clams in haphazard manner. It looked like a dog's breakfast.    The pulpo/grapefruit/fennel salad also didn't look fresh and didn't taste the same from the last 3 previous visits.  Given the high prices, not coming back."
Storm6482,"Dined on April 5, 2015",3,"I was first taken to Casa Mono over 5 years ago, and I had little experience with Michelin starred restaurants at the time.  I was wow'd by everything, justifiably so.  I took my fiance this weekend, and this time, I went with much greater experience in great dining.  The food has held over the years but the service was quite disappointing and almost a little embarrassing since I took my fiance for a special occasion and expected that Casa Mono would make every table feel special.  There was no extra care or attention that was given to us, actually, barely any attention at all.  The bussing staff was very pleasant when dropping off the food but I think the waiter spent a total of 5 minutes at our table all night.  It was the most impersonal dining experience I've had at such a reputable restaurant.  When leaving (after paying more than $200 for our meal), no one even acknowledged our departure.  For that, I have sadly had my last at Casa Mono."
AllOvrNYC,"Dined on March 25, 2015",3,The food is awesome at Casa Mono but they need more space - the place is way too crowded and you always feel pressured to get in and get out quickly.
KINNG,"Dined on March 20, 2015",4,Cozy restaurant with great food
Willajane,"Dined on March 16, 2015",5,"Great food- authentic tapas style. Seafood , veggies and meat- mostly pork. Something for everyone. Great spanish wine list. Crowded and cramped but it's part of the fun."
drcs,"Dined on March 14, 2015",5,Enjoyed our dinner. Selected multiple Tapas.  Worked with the Sommelier to make an excellent wine choice.  Spanish cheese to finish.
DRRDM,"Dined on March 11, 2015",4,"Very good tapas style menu.  Everything that we got that night was excellent, even though they forgot to bring us our razor clams.  The portions are the right size to where you don;t need to order a bunch of plates just to try to get full."
deecath,"Dined on March 8, 2015",5,"We've been coming here every year since our first date, and are always thrilled. The menu is diverse and our server was wonderful at helping us navigate and choose accompaniments that made for an amazing meal. You know you'll be tucked in snugly and well fed. Go with the recess and you won't go wrong!"
Staiffy,"Dined on March 7, 2015",1,"Two of the 6 courses were very good (the razor clams and the beet salad).  The brussel sprouts were cloyingly sweet, swimming in a sugary syrup.  The three meat dishes were cold by the time they were served and the sauces had begun to congeal.  We would not recommend this restaurant."
kiki,"Dined on March 1, 2015",2,"we had a reservation here at 1015 on a saturday night. we asked to sit at the bar instead of a table. the menu is great, inventive but traditional flavors of spanish tapas.  we ordered our food and asked for it to come out slowly, and one at a time.  our first course was served before we even got our wine. so we waited to start eating until we received our wine. from that point on, the plates came out incredibly fast and we couldn't eat them fast enough while they were still warm. we were sitting at the chefs bar and the chefs still prepared our dishes when they could see that we weren't ready for them.  the waitress was nowhere to be found the entire time we were dining and we could see her standing behind the bar drinking with other waitstaff. no one filled our water the entire meal. unfortunately, the service overshadowed the food that were delicious, and likely ever better if we could have eaten them warm."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 1, 2015",3,Disappointing - there was sand in several of the mussels and overall food quality had gone downhill since I went a year ago.
Kbsou97,"Dined on February 26, 2015",5,Great birthday lunch with my mom and friend
Hippo,"Dined on February 26, 2015",3,I would say the size of food was too little for both of us. They shrinked it. Waiters are good looking.
Terrific,"Dined on February 24, 2015",5,"Flavor rules at Casa Mono. Each dish has the intensity you look for in truly great food. Try the razor clams, pulpo, sepia, skirt steak, pork belly, fideos, and many others. Nothing not to like in this place."
hcf2,"Dined on February 23, 2015",4,"Food was very good, if on the saltier side.  Space is tiny--we were wedged into a corner where the waiter had to struggle to reach us, which means he checked up on us less than he should have (plus less water refills, etc).  They had empty tables for the larger area of the restaurant too--they just really wanted to squeeze the 2 person tables into this tiny area."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 20, 2015",4,The food was delicious!
gotosunshine,"Dined on February 14, 2015",5,Amazing tapas food and excellent wine menu. The hostess is extremely nice and very accommodating. Great service. The restaurant is very small but the ambiance is great and it is fabulous in the summer when they open the windows and it feels like you are outside while being inside. Definitely my top restaurant for Spanish food in the city.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 12, 2015",3,"The service has gone downhill. Waitresses had weird attitude, seemed as if they didn't want to serve you, or couldn't wait to get out of work. When I asked for wine recommendation, not only was she disinterested, but simply stopped talking after pointing to one wine on the menu, saying it was fruity and dry, full-stopped.  Been going to both Casa Mono and Bar Jamon, since they first opened...but the most recent experience will likely put a stop to it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 7, 2015",3,"It is normally much better. Coming late, you seem to get the bottom of the casseroles. It remains on of my favorites but i will go earlier next time"
BintheBigApple,"Dined on February 1, 2015",5,"I took my boyfriend to Casa Mono for his birthday, partly because we'd read how great it was and partly because I hoped it would bring back memories of our fantastic trip to Spain last summer. It exceeded my expectations and we had a wonderful night and a truly delicious dinner."
KJtravelers63,"Dined on January 31, 2015",5,"Small neighborhood gem; Michelin award winner with superior quality food/fresh farm ingredients and plenty of menu choices (meat, fish, veggies, etc); amazing dishes with clear ties to traditional Spanish meat & preparation; this is a fun place to try lots of dishes that are high quality in prep, presentation & flavors!   we went as a part of 6 which is tougher for the restaurant (small size; parties of  2 and 4 are ideal) however it we still had a fabulous time. Service is extraordinary; they provide new silverware and plates periodically which is great given sauces and other 'left behind' traces after a few dishes; servers know the wine list well and can provide recommendations with ease based upon your taste preferences and target $"
AllOvrNYC,"Dined on January 31, 2015",3,"The food is absolutely delicious but you get the impression they are in financial trouble from the service. From the moment you walk in the servers are on you to order drinks and food and definitely make it clear they have a quota for flipping tables. Doesn't make for the most relaxed or enjoyable dining experience to have staff breathing down your neck. That said, the food is excellent so as long as you're prepared to fight the staff it's totally worth it!"
Soto,"Dined on January 30, 2015",4,"We spent two weeks in Spain last month and have been re-sampling the Spanish and tapas restaurants in NYC, trying to find something that compares with the amazing food we remembered in Madrid and Barcelona.  Casa Mono does a respectable job in many ways.  First, the disappointment: the Jamon Iberico was dry and cut too thick, so it didn't have the silky mouthfeel or sweetness of the real deal, but to their credit, CM is one of the few places we've found so far where they actually cut it by hand rather than on a slicer.  On the positive side, they had a great action of Spanish wines and the Rioja we selected was lush and round and delicious.  The baby octopus with fennel and grapefruit was a great mix of sweet and savory; the skirt steak with romesco sauce was intensely flavorful and perfectly cooked; the Brussel sprouts with chorizo will convert anyone who does not normally like them; and the peppers stuffed with oxtail were so meltingly delicious and rich that I had to cut them into quarters and wait a few minutes between each bite.  The place is small and invariably packed, and there is nothing to absorb the racket of the enthusiastic crowd, so be sure to prepare for them din.  We'll definitely be back for the food though."
Cather123,"Dined on January 26, 2015",4,"It's not quite being in Barcelona, but comes pretty close.  Cooked food quite delicious, especially the vegetarian dishes.  Best brussells sprouts, great potatoes.  Skip the expensive jamon iberico - it's just not what you'd get in Europe and not worth it.  Pan tomate quite tasty.  Comb the extensive wine list for bottles you can afford, or speak to the helpful wine steward."
alexa,"Dined on January 12, 2015",3,"as a tapas officionado, i was a little bit disappointed in the breadth of both the wine list and the side dishes. the mains took up too much of the menu. definitley get the razor clams and the oxtail. avoid the artichokes with mint (very lemony). not a bottle of wine in the 30-50 dollar range that was my type at all."
Lynn,"Dined on January 10, 2015",5,"We loved everything about Casa Mono - food, service, ambiance.  We often have out-of-town guests, so we will be sure to return for lunch or dinner."
LWilliamz,"Dined on January 10, 2015",2,Casa Mono has been a destination dining experience for me for years. This most recent experience was very poor. We had an early reservation in order to accommodate our evening plans. The restaurant was not busy. The waiter paid us very little attention and did nothing to describe the menu or help build up our experience. The food itself also fell short of my expectations. I'll be finding a new favorite NYC restaurant.
SbsNYC,"Dined on January 9, 2015",5,"The food is varied, tasty, served on small plates. One's tendency is to order practically everything, knowing and trusting that each item will be pleasing. A personal favorite is the bone marrow. The bones are cut lengthwise. Oh my. Also, we were given a taste of the wine in order to choose the one we liked best. This seems a positive good gesture on the part of any good restaurant."
YDV2015,"Dined on January 5, 2015",3,I was drawn to this place because of the pictures they post on Instagram. The food looks AMAZING! And the plates looked like a normal size. Well they're not. All they have is tapas which is fine but get ready to pay $20 or more for each and they're VERY small servings...like the waitress recommended you would need at least 3 to be some what satisfied. We were a group of 4 and our bill was $468 plus tax and gratuity which included 2 bottles of wine. But still I think that's way too much $$$ for just tapas. The place is very low key for that kind of pricing.
Chanukha,"Dined on January 3, 2015",5,I don't think there was a dish that we didn't like. Very consistent and attentive service.  Probably the best tapas in NYC at the moment. Plan ahead and make reservations far out in advance.

Noah,"Dined on December 27, 2014",4,"Haven't been in a while but it was great as always. The food here is the star, the Fidelios are my favorite. But the foie gras was to die for."
Fressman,"Dined on December 25, 2014",4,"We had been to Casa Mono several times in the past, but not for more than a year. We were pleased, as in the past, at the high level of food quality again on this visit. Of the four dishes we had two were absolutely stupendous and the other two were quite good. I don't think I'll bother with dessert the next time, but I will return for the rest."
ywing,"Dined on December 23, 2014",3,Not as good as last time. Food is a bit too salty.
Dirnyl60,"Dined on December 20, 2014",5,"I continue to be impressed with the food, service and general ambiance of this wonderful neighborhood restaurant.  Great wines and wonderful sharing plates, whether for two people or a larger group."
UES84,"Dined on December 10, 2014",4,"I've had both lunch and dinner here.  Dinner was packed and the service was excellent.  During lunch there was barely anyone here yet my friend and I were told to sit in a cold corner by the window.  When asked to move, we were told we could move to another table by the window in a corner.  There was barely anybody there so I'm not sure why we couldn't sit in the middle of the restaurant.  Because we were in the corner, I felt like the waiter forgot about us.  The tapas came out about 20 min apart which was difficult bc the waiter knew we weren't sharing but ordered our own.  The food is excellent which is why I will go back."

Somuchtosee,"Dined on December 7, 2014",5,"Casa Mono is consistently wonderful.  Although it's a small place and it can be difficult to get a reservation, the food is worth the effort; it's creative, delicious and innovative.  I've been many times and still want to go back and try more items on the menu."
Riomalleo,"Dined on December 5, 2014",4,Noise level is pretty high and it is a little difficult to hold a conversation …. especially a romantic one.
Chanukha,"Dined on December 4, 2014",3,"I don't expect to be waited hand and foot in NY, nor to have exceptionally attentive service but Casa Mono takes disinterested service to a new level.  Perhaps the servers don't get paid on time. The waiter kicked my chair maybe 15 times while I was there.  The food is good but I don't know if I will go back. I can't take waiters who seem to be doing me a favor to take my order or get my check."

foodie,"Dined on November 24, 2014",5,"Every single dish was outstanding! We tried the Foie Gras with Cinco Cebollas (super flavourful), Bone Marrow with Tomato Jam and Pickled Sandía (tomato jam was  an uncommon and welcome addition to the bone marrow), Skirt Steak with Romesco and Onion Mermelada (steak was cooked perfectly and the romesco was delicious) and Confit Goat with Avocado Queso, Scallion Ash and Pistachios (the avocado was a great complement to the goat).   For dessert, we had the Pudín de Pan and the Chocolate, Crème Fraîche, Cherry Calimocho. Both were delicious!"
MAndersen,"Dined on November 16, 2014",5,"A splendid tapas bar! The space is small and vibrant; the selections are unusual but can also accommodate less adventurous palates,from jamón serrano,fried squid , and quail to Duck egg , bone marrow, crispy pig's  ears. Service very good.  The selection of Spanish wines is spectacular.  It is noisy, though less so at lunch.  This makes it all the more authentically ""Spanish,"" I would argue."
lovetotravel,"Dined on November 11, 2014",1,"My husband and I went to this restaurant specifically to try the sea urchin. While the food was good, the rest of the experience was lacking.The waitress was very inattentive, never explained the plates to us, and we needed to look like we where shooing away hornets in order to get her attention. The server, when delivering our plates only mumbled. I was also disappointed that the wine list only carried dry wines, thus I ate my meal with just water."
PeckhamIndian,"Dined on November 10, 2014",5,"A fantastic gem serving innovative dishes, as cook I will be stealing their ideas! Great wine list too. The staff are excellent - I only wish I had listened to my waitress when she told me not to order so much, but the menu is so inviting for one who has eyes bigger than their stomach. I would certainly recommend Casa Mono."
Diner,"Dined on November 8, 2014",4,"The pan con tomate was spectacular.  The pulpo was good but not spectacular, and the marrow was a little short on marrow, but still tasty."
Atilla,"Dined on November 8, 2014",4,"This was probably my 10th visit over the past several years.  In the past I have always found everything to be first rate and the flavors of the various dished making it more than worthwhile to put up with the crowded, cramped dining room.  This time the service, and more importantly, the food were not up to past standards.  For example, the quail was several stages beyond well done and the beet dish (always a favorite in the past) was approaching the end of its shelf life.  I hope this was simply an off-night for both the kitchen and the wait staff."
LoveNYCdining,"Dined on November 8, 2014",4,The food was very good but the space was too crowded.  Very little leg room.  The wine list was outrageously priced.
MadameKebab,"Dined on November 4, 2014",5,"This is a place to keep on the top of your list. It's a very special place and the food is very creative and delicious.  It can be a bit noisy, so you have to be in the mood, but once you settle in you forget about it. Dinner reservations you have to book well ahead. Lunch is fantastic and not too crowded."

Angostura,"Dined on November 4, 2014",5,"I love everything about this restaurant, the location is perfect, the menu is inventive and there is always something that will please any palate with its variety of dishes, the amazing 100% Spanish wine list, the service is very attentive. It's tiny and quaint and it reminds me of so many places I've eaten in Spain. This is one of my regular choices for places to have lunch with a friend or a client or to have an intimate dinner with a couple of people.  This is one of the places you must try if you are visiting New York. Not for children, not for large groups!"

mannieelizabeth,"Dined on November 2, 2014",4,"I've been there twice now and I think it's amazing. It's a very small place. Some might claim it is too tight... But the food and service are perfect. I went with my mom and we shared 5 courses and 2 desserts accompanied with a bottle of rose. Each dish got better and better! We had sea bass cevice, octopus, scallops, foie gras and rabbit. The rabbit was the most filling and satisfying (entree size) and the foie gras was served in a way I've never had before and was so rich. Our server was so nice and helpful, I let him pick our desserts, olive oil ice cream and chocolate creme fraiche. You can either sit at the bar, kitchen counter, or table. All three are great experiences in their own way. Will be going back again for a special occasion!"
Trimalchio,"Dined on November 2, 2014",3,"Inventive, tasty tapas in an extremely small space.  The staff copes well with the limitations.  $21 is too much for a glass of wine.  Not a place to linger.  Coat check should be provided gratis by the house.  Expecting yet another tip for so essential a service smacks of extortion."

bostonsuzette,"Dined on November 1, 2014",3,"We made a special trip from Boston to Casa Mono in NYC to relive the great cuisine we enjoyed in Spain this past summer.  However, we were disappointed.  The dishes sounded exciting and innovative on the menu, but the bold fresh flavors were not there in some dishes and the execution was uneven.  The razor clams were flavorful but too chewy, and I suspect overgrilled. The oxtails in peppers lacked a richness in taste. The baby octopus also tasted overcooked and we've had better elsewhere.  However the goat was perfect, and the eggs with sea urchin was deliciously memorable.  The service was superb!  But for the $$$, it was good food, but not a memorable food experience."

Its fun to share tastes and though I have been back several times, the quality is always superb and there is often something new on the menu. My favorites are the skirt steak, the razor clams, the goat fritte, the sea bass ceviche. Actually, every dish is great - it just depends on your mood. I like sitting at the bar when there are just two of us because it is fun to watch the chefs prepare the food."
FLLdiner,"Dined on October 26, 2014",5,"Our best meal, hands down, during 4 days in NYC.  This is seriously good eating.  Sweetbreads, octopus, headcheese, all dressed up with the most delicious accompaniments.  The room is vibrant and the diners are serious.  It's all good."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 21, 2014",2,"The food and service has gone down hill dramatically here.  Four or Five years ago you got a really meal of tapas, but the quality has gone down dramatically and the prices are really terrible for the value you get.  Unfortunately I will not be returning in the future as there is far better value (and more space to sit) in numerous tapas-inspired restaurants throughout the city."

ESNFit,"Dined on August 16, 2014",4,"This is one of those restaurants that does not necessarily stand out; it is a small corner spot that I would probably have never explored if it hadn't been for a colleague's recommendation. However, it was one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had. The food was carefully prepared, beautifully presented, and bursting with flavor. The best part of it all was that we had the opportunity to sit at the counter and watch all of the food be prepared. The wine list is extensive--definitely expensive, but we were not unsatisfied. The service was also excellent. Our waiter helped us choose an appropriate wine (that we loved) and the chefs, while in action, were happy to answer our questions."
RAHPT,"Dined on August 15, 2014",4,"Small and intimate interior. I would consider bar if single or small group to watch cooks. Excellent food, small portions, but delicious. Decent wine selection. Great servers: knowledge and service. Adequate support staff but seemed to be just doing their job."
Vishne,"Dined on August 14, 2014",4,"We're occasional customers at Casa Mono and always enjoy the food and wine. This time we tried out their restaurant week menu. The food (other than the dessert) was delicious, featuring a particularly outstanding pulpo appetizer served on a bed of creamy avocado, but the portions were tiny. I say this as a petite woman: three slices of chorizo does not a main course make, even at lunch. My chocolate cake was tragically stale: it looked like a molten cake, and possibly was one when the pastry chef took it out of the oven a couple of months ago, but by the time it reached my fork it was cold, hard, and insipid. But by that point I was too merrily sloshed on the brimming quartino of rose our server clandestinely poured for me to care."
NYCGER,"Dined on August 12, 2014",4,"We used restaurant week as an excuse to try as many dishes as possible - we ordered one of everything on the special lunch menu.  The favorites were:  paella croquetas, pulpo, the grilled tomato, dorado, and for dessert, the chocolate cake and the melon sorbet.  Most of these items are not on the regular menu, so my advice to future diners is try everything!  NB - this place is tiny!  There are very few tables and they are so close together, you can share a dish with your neighbors without stretching.  Eating at the counter might be a better option..."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 11, 2014",2,"It used to be one of my favoriate restaurant. But after my latest lunch visit during NYC Restaurant Week, I am a little hesitate to say so. To be fair, the food is still good there. But the service is the worst I've ever seen. The waitress asks if we would like to order any wine first. After I told her that no wine for us as we need to go back to the office. She abruptly left and we waited there forever for her to be back to take order. And she didn't show up again during the entire meal. And they charge $10 for syrup on sobert?? $10 to make up the profilt for participating in NYRW? When I try to reason this with her, she said ""don't show me the attitude""..... I can't believe Casa Mono hires such a rude person to damage it's reputation."
sandrab,"Dined on August 4, 2014",2,"The size of the portions for appetizer and entree were ridiculously infinitesimal and could hard,be considered lunch!! Secondly, our waiter couldn't describe the dishes and seemed annoyed we asked, disappeared and was generally not interested in providing the attention a waiter should. They shouldn't be on Restaurant Week if they're not going to offer an appropriate meal!!!"
Buburin,"Dined on August 4, 2014",1,Not very impressive. Would not recommend this place. The choice for tapas were I impressive and ridiculously priced. Skip it!
Cookiegirl27,"Dined on August 4, 2014",5,This Michelin star restaurant has am eclectic and amazing menu of small and a few large to share using organic meats and accompaniments! Delicious meal and ambiance. Reservations are a must as it's a hard table to get as a walk in!
LadyM666,"Dined on August 3, 2014",4,We really loved all foods we ordered… already discussed go back again!!!
CasaMonoFan,"Dined on August 1, 2014",5,One of my favorite dining places in the city. Everything there is delicious.
Gera,"Dined on July 31, 2014",5,"I was very satisfied with the appetizer, but my entree was as big as my appetizer basically.  Other than that everything was delicious."
Moses,"Dined on July 29, 2014",3,"The food is what shines at Mono. The small plates are great for sharing.  The tables are close together, so a noisy neighbor can be an issue.  Service wasn't up to One Star standards.  The staff seemed untrained and rushed.  A waiter plunked down a dish on our table and left so quickly we couldn't tell him it wasn't what we ordered.  It took several minutes to get anyone's attention to explain. When they ran my credit card the slip I was given to sign had a higher amount on it than my bill (about 20% higher).  I thought it might be a gratuity, but there was a line for tips.  The waiter said it was wrong and re-ran my card."
UWSMom,"Dined on July 29, 2014",4,"A great first visit to Casa Mono. We had the chickpea fritters, green tomato w/ goat cheese, chorizo and a few other items all were terrific. The creme catalan was a spectacular finish to the meal. There was a lot of staff in the restaurant who were pleasant but not overly friendly.  Not the best choice with kids ( who loved the food)  only because of the tight table space and the staff  didn't know how to deal with them."
cz123,"Dined on July 24, 2014",3,"Food and service are good. but the space is really small. The restaurant week menu is not as good as regular menu. we ordered from the regular menu, it's pretty tasty."
DougsDad,"Dined on July 23, 2014",4,"This was one of our favourite restaurants in NYC, when it was on the way up... This time was so so. Food still good, but from a more limited menu. And nothing blew us away this time, which had been our experience in the past. Maybe the success has allowed them to coast.  We were seated early (told that it was our only option), but the restaurant remained mostly empty around us for the two hours we were there."
Kate,"Dined on July 22, 2014",1,"One  disspointing evening. Rude, careless waiters in an excessively noisy ambience made it impossible to enjoy neither food nor conversation. Never again."
Vd00,"Dined on July 15, 2014",5,"Really outstanding service, inventive and eye opening food and a well curated wine selection for all price ranges makes this restaurant truly worthy of a michelin star. My only comment would be a suggestion to have more off-menu seasonal items available. The one item they did have, I tried (it was roasted eggplanted over an eggplant/anise puree) and it was fantastic!"
Foodie,"Dined on July 13, 2014",4,We had a great early dinner . The food and wines made us feel like we were transported to Spain for the afternoon !We recommend Casa Mono to foodies and others that are looking for new tastes.
brooklynisbetter,"Dined on July 12, 2014",3,"some dishes are good, but some are just not that great.  it's way overpriced, like all tapas joints. we won't go back."
BegoQ,"Dined on July 10, 2014",5,Incredible food and service!!the scallops and lambada leg amazing!! Also Mono Salad deliciosa! Very nice place!
tester,"Dined on July 6, 2014",5,"A great combination of atmosphere, service and amazing food.  The wait-staff and wine-guy are not snooty but are very knowledgeable and helpful.  They bring out the tapas with perfect order and timing.  Small place, but a very pleasant atmosphere.  The sauces are world-class.  Only imperfect thing is that I think the desserts are not quite as good as everything else.  E.g. bread pudding was flavorful but too sweet."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 2, 2014",5,"Such a wonderful restaurant. Whenever we're in NY, we always make sure we eat at Casa Mono...great food, great ambience... Wish we could bring you with us to Hawaii"
Wastingfoodisasin,"Dined on July 1, 2014",3,"Too crowded to wait at bar counter, so I had to wait outside for all my friends to gather. Food was good, but size was small if you consider the price. If you were a Spanish wine lover, this restaurant is the must to go."
John,"Dined on June 30, 2014",5,"Perhaps the best Tapas in NYC. Great wine list - principally Spanish as is appropriate. Irving Place is a reasonably quiet street so when they leave the sliding doors open it is quite comfortable. Love to sit at the bar and watch how they turn out the variety of dishes as quickly as they do. I have only done lunch at Casa Mono. It is a small space so I can imagine it is overflowing at dinner.  Particularly enjoyed the razor clams, octopus with fennel and crispy pork belly."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 27, 2014",2,"While our actual server was great, we were stunned by the fact that both the hosts refused to allow us to sit down because the third member of our party had not arrived, at 4:55 PM when the restaurant had TWO customers in it only and it was 85 degrees outside. Talk about a stupid policy. Our friend was late, so while we explained we were happy to sit and begin reading the menu and even ordering on our friends behalf, they refused. Then when our friend did arrive at 5:15 they informed us we would have to ""hurry up"" and be out by seven because they needed the table. The food here is good, but we were all surprised by the obvious stupidity of policy over common sense and hospitality. Our check would have been much higher if they'd let us sit."
MicheA,"Dined on June 22, 2014",5,"If you ever had the opportunity to eat at Bar Pinotxo at La Boqueria in Barcelona the food here is the closest you'll get in NYC, with upgraded service and fantastic wine.  This is an exceptional dining experience."
Papaya,"Dined on June 22, 2014",4,"Casa Mono is one of my favorite tapas spots in the city. I always find something new on their menu that I need to try. This time around, the stand out dish was Fideos with Chorizo and Clams. Quite literally, the entire table just FOUGHT OVER the savory fideo noodles and fresh clams. I would go back and order 2 next time. The foie was a bit underwhelming in portion/price, but pig ears and squid was also widely enjoyed and fun to eat. Overall, a great experience as always."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 22, 2014",5,What a find. Great tapas and fantastic ambience. We wanted a good restaurant for a special night out in New York and we certainly found it in Casa Mona.
Decepcionado,"Dined on June 16, 2014",1,"We really didn´t like it at all. It is a pretentious restaurant. The food comes not in small, but in tiny portions, but of course at steep prices. It is not a Spanish food restaurant (nothing with Uni can be called a Spanish-food restaurant). I´d never go back again, never."
soakaroo,"Dined on June 14, 2014",4,If you love Tapas this is pretty good.  It's almost Spain like good.   A little pricey if you don't mind.  Service might be a little slow but definitely worth a try.
E2nyc,"Dined on June 13, 2014",5,always a favorite. service is excellent and food is always consistent.
fun2eat,"Dined on June 13, 2014",4,"The regular menu plus specials provide great choices for everyone.  The food is consistently very good, with courses timed very well.  The staff is friendly and the wait staff particularly knowledgeable.  Warm weather allows the restaurant to open the doors giving an ""outdoor feel"".  Always a great choice."
Ellibelli,"Dined on June 9, 2014",3,"Food was pretty good overall, though my setas & garlic (mushrooms) was way too salty, we couldn't eat it."
jsm23,"Dined on June 7, 2014",5,"I've been coming to this restaurant for almost a decade and it has never disappointed. I love that my favorite dishes (fideos with clams, sweetbreads, bacalao) are always on the menu, but do not remain stagnant, with pleasant and surprising tweaks to the preparation. On this visit, the crispy pork belly was rich and sweet and meltingly delicious, and the blackened beet salad amazed this beet-hater, it may have been my favorite dish of the night! One change I noticed since my last visit a few years ago is that the waiters and hosts, while still very knowledgeable, were much friendlier this time and, gasp, even smiled! Lovely. (But where are the wonderful tables with the little desks underneath? Was it just mine, or are they all gone? Pity!)"
hyrax,"Dined on June 6, 2014",5,"This is my second time visiting casa mono, it is always my favorite"
reviewer,"Dined on June 6, 2014",5,"Had 6 plates between the two of us, each an excellent adventure.  Goat confit was the favorite by a nose.  We ordered wine by the glass due to the varied nature of our dishes.  We were very impressed by the attention paid by the sommelier.  This was a nice touch.  Crowded and noisy, but what would one expect from a Manhattan hot spot?"
Mike,"Dined on June 1, 2014",2,Had always heard that this was the best tapas place in NY. We were unimpressed by the food - we ordered some of the more famous dishes and werent really wowed by any of them. The service wasnt too great and the dining room was small and cramped. Wouldnt be going back here any time soon.
Louandwamp,"Dined on May 28, 2014",2,"Over cooked seafood, and seemingly everything overpriced for small servings.  The ramps with romesco were delicious. Service was best part of meal."
Alpr,"Dined on May 25, 2014",5,"Tapas style, great way to eat several menu items. Food was very flavorful. They cannot accommodate parties larger than 6. Everyone enjoyed their meal."
ABCalifornia,"Dined on May 25, 2014",4,"Good wine selection and interesting menu choices, great small plates.  Would definitely o back - moderate pricing too."
CRMD,"Dined on May 24, 2014",5,"Imagine sharing dishes that you have to fight over...so delectable that you would run over your grandmother to get a 2nd bite.  Sure, the dishes are perfect for sharing...make certain that you get 6-7 for a full evening's meal, but don't be surprised if you are jousting your partner for the last bite or jamon or lamb belly."
DoubleA,"Dined on May 23, 2014",5,This bar is fabulas.  Food quality is 5 stars on par with the top tapas places in Barcelona   Small but good ambiance and service
CatherineH,"Dined on May 23, 2014",4,"I had been wanting to get to Casa Mono for a while and finally tried it for lunch. (When it opened it was just too crowded.)  The food is very good, very sharable, not horribly pricey.  We had oxtail stuffed piquillo peppers, silky scallops, salad with manchego and everything was great.   Our server was completely bored by us.  She asked a question and then looked out the window waiting for a reply.  I'm not sure if she had teeth --if so, she never showed them with a smile.   The place is very small, so you have to wait on the sidewalk for your party to arrive as they will not seat you for 5 minutes alone -- even at a 1:30 lunchtime with a half empty restaurant.  Mario needs to read one of Danny Meyer's customer service books."
alwayshungry,"Dined on May 22, 2014",5,"Tiny cramped space but well worth it.  Every plate was delicious, creative and almost addictve.  Pigs ears, fideos, pulpo, pork belly, anchovies.  Bring some friends so you try more dishes.  Union Square gem.  Sorry I didn't discover this place sooner."
jojonyc,"Dined on May 22, 2014",5,"First time there and loved it! Sat at the bar looking at the open kitchen, very fun dining experience.  Food was great! A couple dishes were indeed a bit on the salty side as some reviews said on here, but flavor-wise still very good."
Atilla,"Dined on May 21, 2014",4,"I have dined here half a dozen times in the past year.  Some of the dishes are inspired while others are good.  If you would like tapas, but cannot make it to Spain, then this is a very good choice.  The dining area is, to say the least, ""cozy""; this impacts the service as it is difficult for the wait staff to move around.  The wine list is excellent."
frequentdiner,"Dined on May 16, 2014",4,"Very creative menu.  Superb tapas, razor clams, foie gras, fideus, and so on and so forth.  Terrific wine list with wonderful Spanish wines.  Tight spaces."
andycali6,"Dined on May 5, 2014",5,"I liked EVERYTHING! A bit pricey, but I highly recommend it."
wineanddinegirl,"Dined on May 5, 2014",5,"The bottom line is that Casa Mono is a wonderful dining experience! It is a small restaurant with a huge opportunity to taste truly uniquely prepared food! Musts on their menu ... foie gras, pork belly, quail ... our group of four enjoyed the small plates, adding and ordering more choices as we sat sipping our wine and becoming more and more adventuresome as the evening wore on.  Mario Batali deserves his Michelin stars for this restaurant!"
Jacq,"Dined on May 4, 2014",5,The food at Casa Mono was absolutely amazing. The butterscotch scallops was the best thing I've had in months!
marlene,"Dined on May 4, 2014",4,"we've dined here a number of times and the food is consistently very good. The tables are pretty close , not a lot of space to move around, but the good wines help you forget this impediment:) Consider 2 tapas per person to share , that would be enough,"
francemichele,"Dined on May 3, 2014",4,"I keep going back and every time I'm dazzled by the array of flavors in their tapas, such creative cooking. Among my favorite the foie gras, the marrow bones, the razor clams, the artichokes with miny"
debbpaer,"Dined on April 30, 2014",5,"My friend was in from out of town and I took her here for lunch.  We ordered the foie gras, the bone marrow, the duck egg and cured tuna, the confit goat, and the pig's ears (and an ambulance).  It was ALL AMAZING!  The chef was great to watch, she made it look so easy.  But everything was nailed.  Such a great experience.  I've been 3 times now for lunch and dinner and each time is fantastic."
Jackie,"Dined on April 29, 2014",4,Unique menu! Everything was yummy. Great location as well.
Wonderfulwino,"Dined on April 28, 2014",4,"The razor clams are fantastic, the foie gras is outstanding, etc., but has Casa Mono become a bit static or complacent? Let's add some new and innovative dishes to the menu..."
foodie225,"Dined on April 27, 2014",4,"Everything on the menu is great - my favorites were the quail, bone marrow, and patatas bravas. The staff also provides excellent wine recommendations for the food you order. The only complaint I have is the strict rule against ordering more food - seems very inflexible!"
gourmet,"Dined on April 22, 2014",5,"Casa Mono has unique and luscious food! I adored this  restaurant, had high expectations and was not disappointed. The mushroom,potato,and scallop dishes were divine! Anyone who truly LOVES great food will be unbelievably happy here."
Jecca2244,"Dined on April 20, 2014",5,"Awesome meal. Wine list is fantastic and really accessible. We were sat a bit late for our reservation ( it happens, it is NYC!) but they sent over a complimentary round of cava and an appetizer. Loved the Patatas Bravas, duck egg, liver toast, pigs ears, artichoke, Brussels sprouts. So delicious."
kdh2812,"Dined on April 19, 2014",3,"The food at Casa Mono is delicious, inventive and well-presented. The service is okay, waitress was pleasant enough but the hostess was not. We were seated at a crowded, middle of the floor table although there were 6 more comfortable tables at the windows available. Over the two hours that we were there for lunch, 3 of those tables were never occupied. We did ask for one of those tables and were told they were reserved. Typical NYC power-play attitude. There are too many great places to go back to one with a bad attitude. When spending $200 at lunch, I expect more."
Danzilla,"Dined on April 19, 2014",5,"Every about this place is perfect. Food is always amazing, the wine is very very good, the ambience is great. Love it."
Dineout88,"Dined on April 18, 2014",4,"High quality tapas style dishes. Recommend the razor clams, duck egg with potatoes and the lamb with chocolate sauce.  Very good Spanish wine list."
Dkstar1,"Dined on April 17, 2014",3,"The food was mostly very good. Demerit for the one razor clam that was 1/3 uncooked (runny).  Major props for the lamb leg, pork sausage and rabbit dishes. Wine list was interesting and was happy with the bottle we got with helpful assistance from the somm. However in their desire to turn tables faster than any restaurant I've ever been, 1/2 full glasses of wine repeatedly got filled which was both annoying and detrimental to the pleasures of seeing a new (to me) wine evolve in the glass.   Great local spot, very tight, good to very good food, pleasant but rushing staff. Wouldn't go out of my way to go back but would be a regular at the bar stools if I lived in the neighborhood."
Yagarmeister,"Dined on April 15, 2014",4,"Excellent service! Wonderful flavors! Adorable place! It is a bit tight, but not uncomfortable. Worth a try. Will go on my favorites list."
MinnieR,"Dined on April 5, 2014",4,"This is my second time to eat at Casa Mono and I enjoyed it again. The razor clams, bacalao croqueta, and skirt steak are good. I dis not enjoy the iberico ham as much on this visit because it was served last, it should be served before the other saucy dishes this way we can savor the meat without palate prejudices. The cava and blood orange cocktail was refreshing, I ordered 3 glasses. I recommend the crema catalan with bay leaves for dessert. Service was good. We would have stayed longer and ordered more dishes and drinks but the hard wooden chairs were hurting my lower back, so we rushed to get out of there. Will be back again to try the other dishes and drinks we missed."
fresser53,"Dined on April 3, 2014",4,"Since it has been open, Casa Mono has been a fabulous purveyor of Spanish food. Not tapas, per se, but small plates that run the gamut of interesting ingredients and flavors. You could eat at Casa Mono 25 times and never have the same meal twice. Flavors or bold and interesting, but not overwhelming. All-Spanish wine list is comprehensive, and a good selection is available by the quarto, or small carafe. Tables are a little cramped, but that's because it's a small place. If you can, grab a seat at the counter by the open kitchen."
frequentdiner,"Dined on March 31, 2014",4,"Fantastic and varied menu of tapas. The razor clams, the bone marrow and the goat are standouts. Terrific wine list of Spanish wines."

Pearly,"Dined on March 29, 2014",2,"We were a party of three who was seated at a table for two in this very small and cramped restaurant. The hostess would not budge when we inquired about another table. (It was noon and there only two other parties seated at that time.) Our waitress, who overall was good, told us that we 'needed' to order all of our small plates at once rather than start with a few selections and move on from there. We picked the wrong spot for a relaxing, weekend lunch!"
Sonja,"Dined on March 28, 2014",4,"Super restaurant, very good service and good food"
Arthur,"Dined on March 28, 2014",4,Best place in New York for grilled razor clams. Wonderful with a sear and garlic olive oil finishing. Always go there as many times I can when in New York. Great for a smack in late afternoon.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 28, 2014",2,"I rarely provide feedback. Casa Mono has great Spanish food, with a respectable wine list to match. It could have been an enjoyable experience if not for the hostess! She was short, unfriendly, and rude. Not at all what you would expect from someone in a customer service role. There are too many choices in NYC to be subjected to a teenage like attitude from the person who sets the tone for your dining experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 27, 2014",5,I make it a point to fit in a lunch or dinner at Casa Mono whenever I visit NYC and love introducing it to my business friends. The food and service are excellent and the vibe makes you feel like you are a resident of the city.

2XtheScrilla,"Dined on March 25, 2014",5,"Casa Mono is a must for me whenever I go to NYC and my favorite Batali restaurant. I'm a fan of small plates, casual vibes, and Spanish wines, so this place is right in my sweet spot. The food is always excellent, the service is always friendly and attentive. Makes me think I need to make the trip back more often..."
bac528,"Dined on March 22, 2014",5,Definitely has joined my NYC top 5 list!!
Cindy,"Dined on March 22, 2014",3,"The food was good, although it's a tiny place so you do feel cramped the entire time. The biggest complaint was the dessert...our waitress recommended the chocolate dessert and made it sound fantastic...what did she bring out? a plate that had a smear of nuttela, a smear of something else and a friend banana. That does not qualify as even a half decent dessert, especially for the price!!! The goat is funny tasting and would not recommend it. The rest of the food was good, especially their mushrooms, bread with tomato, and potatoes."
Lahu,"Dined on March 19, 2014",4,"I lived in Spain for 10 years and have never had Pan Con Tomate this good! Great neighborhood spot, delicious dishes, hard to get a table because it's always so busy, but worth trying to get that booking! We were on time but our table wasn't ready so they suggested we have a drink at the bar next door (owned by same people) - Bar Jamon. I'd have preferred to have been seated straight away but the manager of the bar was great, was helpful with the wine choices, and when we'd waited a little while they even brought over a starter free of charge. That's better treatment than a LOT of restaurants in manhattan! My only minor complaint is that it's so tiny that the tables are really pretty squished together."
HeatherF,"Dined on March 17, 2014",5,I've been to Casa Mono twice and both times have walked away impressed and satisfyingly full. Each time I have dined here I have eaten ingredients I would not normally order and have been blown away by their preparation and flavor. The staff is very knowledgable and helpful with their extensive wine list and helped us in ordering a wine that complemented all of our dishes. The atmosphere is cozy and perfect for a date! Will look forward to visiting again.
Atilla,"Dined on March 15, 2014",4,"The food features combinations of ingredients that range from those that work well to, in some cases, are spectacular. If in doubt, the staff is very good about describing things on the menu. Even if you order at random, you are sure to have a few unbelievably good choices. The liver and pate offerings are always a safe bet....in this case 'safe' means certain to be spectacular.  The wine list is extensive with a broad range of prices and varietals from various regions of spain.  The one down-side, especially for large and/or tall people....the tables are small and without much legroom.  Overall an excellent choice for an informal, but noteworthy meal."
GaryF,"Dined on March 12, 2014",4,"I liked everything about this place. It's a good vibe, professional service, good wine selection at reasonable prices, great menu. If only I hadn't order the sardines…and I love sardines. They were, well, chewy. Ah, I can overlook one dish one time. I'll be back."
Fooder,"Dined on March 9, 2014",4,"Everything we ordered was very good. The place is a bit squeezed and the wine service could be better - as usual in NYC the red wine was served at room temperature, a basic mistake. Apart from that the food was good enough to justify a future return. Recommended."
FoodieGal,"Dined on March 9, 2014",5,"I've been several times. The menu, which changes seasonally, is always exciting. Casa Mono is on my personal top five favorite restaurant list."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 7, 2014",3,It was impossible to relax and celebrate my husband's birthday with our two adult children because of the rude and disruptive service we received from the moment we arrived until we left.

Elvin,"Dined on March 5, 2014",5,"As a serious sucker for tapas and Spanish food, I came into here with high expectations. The place did not disappoint. There are so many unique interesting combos and delicious foods. Add on the incredibly comprehensive wine lists and highly knowledgeable waiters with knowledge of all the dishes, they helped pick out all the tapas that hit the right spot. I highly enjoyed my time here and would gladly do it again."

After much back and forthing between us and the maitre de (who in no way apologizes even though we have a reservation) she takes a cold ,silent stand implying we sit in the middle of the room or just leave. We sat in the middle of the room……5 minutes later (maybe 7 ?) she seats another pair of patrons at one of those tables and when we leave one hour later two tables were still empty !! …..but no….she'd made her point !

NoraBernadette,"Dined on February 25, 2014",4,"Casa Mono was a great restaurant for a couple, whether you are friends or on a first date or special occasion, the cozy restaurant appeals to all. The food was phenomenal, small sharing plates although slightly bigger than other tapas restaurants. The wine list was huge, although didn't have too many reasonable bottles. I wouldn't recommend for groups, and certainly go with a reservation. The pork croquettes and the chocolate salted ganache were both standouts."

TravelingFoodies,"Dined on February 23, 2014",1,"We had to wait an extra half hour for reservations. The waiter took forever to take our order. At least 2 dishes were never delivered to our table. When the reservations were made I said we were celebrating a birthday which was never noted. And, one of your chefs was texting on his phone will preparing and never walked his hands. We watched him do this for a few minutes. Needless to say none of the 6 people on our group ever plan on returning."
frequentdiner,"Dined on February 22, 2014",5,"Creative and varied tapas, better than I've had in Barcelona and San Sebastien. The razor clams are amazing, also mushroooms, goat, artichokes, etc. Large Spanish wine list with something for everyone. Service was fast and knowledgeable, with the waiter recommending an excellent and affordable wine, when asked."
restaurantgroupie,"Dined on February 22, 2014",2,"While the food was tasty, the portions served for RW lunch were a complete joke. Usually RW lunch is too much food, 3 courses, dessert, etc. Us three girls left hungry. Also, they crammed our three top at the smallest table ever, even though it was the very end of lunch service. I guess since the plates of food were so small, we didn't have too many issues, but they had to remove our small bread plates to start serving food. Highly do not recommend this place for RW lunch. My previous experience at dinner was better."

Aliceinwonderland,"Dined on February 18, 2014",1,"It was my first experience at the Restaurant Weekend and at this restaurant. We booked at 4PM because my husband and a friend had to work in the morning and there wasn't any other hour available before that. When we sat at the table we were told that the special restaurant week menu wasn't available anymore, only until 3:30PM. First question is where can the customer read this information? Obviously we weren't aware of it. We are from Spain and miss fabada. This course was offered in the special menu but not in the usual one. We asked for fabada, just in case, but there was no possibility of having it. We ended up paying more than double the restaurant week menu and not enjoying the meal at all. We felt rip-off."
fuzzylemon,"Dined on February 17, 2014",5,"Really good food. There seemed to be a hiccup with the service, in that we were seated and asked about our water preference....and then sat there for 10 minutes. I had to ask the hostess to bring water and then ask if we actually had a waiter assigned to us. But once we got a waiter, the service was friendly and efficient. The food was very, very good. Really solid on both traditional tapas and imaginative dishes. Highly recommend."
nannysue,"Dined on February 16, 2014",4,"Delicious food, great combinations. Amazing to believe that the meal comes out of such a tiny kitchen. The restaurant is very small, almost uncomfortably so. Bottom line: worth it for the food."
Goodtimes,"Dined on February 16, 2014",5,"The food was fantastic, cozy place, good and quick service. Not for strollers as the space is limited."
marlene,"Dined on February 15, 2014",4,we have tried several tapas and they were all good!!! excellent wine list (some very expensive though). You can't beat the location-perfect for Union Square . we will go back soon
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 15, 2014",3,"For such a nice restaurant, with amazing food and a great reputation, I was shocked with how poor the service was."
Vieve,"Dined on February 12, 2014",4,"My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed the food. The razor clams amazed all of us, even those who proclaimed they don't like razor clams. And I, who have been averse to sweetbreads since my first try, loved the fried sweetbreads here. They were reminiscent of fried chicken of the best variety.  But the waitstaff could have been more attentive. When we had their attention, they were great. But when we weren't engaged with them directly, we had to try several times to flag someone down before we succeeded in getting our water refilled.  Maybe it was just an off night. I'd still come back to give it a try."
Mario,"Dined on February 9, 2014",4,The food is creative and great.
toby,"Dined on February 5, 2014",4,"I took a few of my colleagues (wine lovers) over to this place. Being there a several times, I love this place and was confident that the place will be good for them as well.  Our first disappointment: They asked us to order all food and drinks upfront. We were surprised that we had to plan out our bottles (we wanted to start out with white and then go for reds afterwards) and tapas dishes. It took us a couple of inquiries and about half an hour before we settled on all of our dishes and drinks.  Second Disappointment: Razor clam was one of my favorite dish there, but this night, it was awfully fishy... and didn't pair with wine. I'm now wondering if this dish was ill prepared or the clam was bad."
Jeff,"Dined on February 5, 2014",5,Always one of my favorites. Especially eating at the kitchen bar!
StefaniaK,"Dined on February 4, 2014",4,"My favorite of all the Mario restaurants - food is consistently good and innovatively prepared. Small plates are filling and there is a great variety to select from. The restauratant is congested, tables are crowded and service/greetings can sometimes be abrupt (and incomplete parties will NOT be seated). Generally once seated, the service is efficient, often friendly and the food speaks for itself. The wine list is extensive and tends toward expensive, though the red wine quarto we selected, was reasonably priced and excellent. It can get noisy too --- so the less crowded/noisy Sunday brunch can really be an enjoyable alternative to evenings."
User0328,"Dined on February 2, 2014",5,The food there is really appealing and i would come again definitely but the service is kinda taking off some points. Around 5pm they had a meeting for the waiters and waitresses so we had to wait a long time for our food or anything.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 29, 2014",5,"first time to casa mono, took a friend for her birthday. we both loved it so much. the service was excellent- our waiter was attentive and helped to navigate the menu when we needed recommendations and worried we ordered too much food and needed to know which ones were the best. The quality of the food was superb and just the right seasonings. My favourites were the scallops, ribeye special, and rabbit. We were lucky and got a corner table so our location was nice and quiet. Didn't take much look at the wine list so can't speak too much on that, but the Riesling that was recommended went well with our food. Would definitely return."
TRWG,"Dined on January 28, 2014",5,"Great time at Casa Mono. Food was inventive, well prepared right in front of us, and creatively plated. Service was outstanding, especially for as busy as it was and how tight the restaurant is. Loud, energetic, and a whole lot of fun."
CTNYC,"Dined on January 27, 2014",2,Inspired dishes but each dish was overly salty and oily.  Would not come back.

ms0926,"Dined on January 20, 2014",4,"8:30 reservation on a Sunday. Seated immediately in an otherwise full house. Food was exceptional. Small plates concept but portions were quite generous. Server kindly made wine suggestions upon request which were spot on. Wine list is pricey, but worth it. After dinner sherry, also suggested by server, was perfect end to the meal."
Meghan,"Dined on January 18, 2014",1,"Food was poor. The pork croquette was very dry. However, I must say the goat was surprisingly good. We had a table next to a shelf of red wine. When I inquired as to where the wine was from. He responded ""it's all Spanish"". I asked where, what region. Because the name of the bottle wasn't spanish. He didn't know and kept repeating 'all spanish'. for a spanish tapas restaurant I was disappointed the waiter didn't know this. The desserts were awful. We had the chocolate and white chocolate with fennel. Don't order! The white chocolate dessert tastes medicinal and the caramelized fennel is not a nice addition. In addition the waiter seemed annoyed when I mentioned I was allergic to seafood."
Wmw322,"Dined on January 17, 2014",4,"I was on time my guest not so much by 12 minutes. After checking in I was refused my seat until I was a full party of 2. Ridiculous procedure as were I a solo diner I'd be given the same table. She sat us at a center table crammed next to 2 other diners. I asked to be sat at the end table, she refused me saying she had to push the 2 tables together when we left for a 4 top. Made ZERO sense! & guess what, she sat a couple there not 10 minutes later. She lied! I expect a better greeting & treatment from this Michelin noted, charming hot spot on Irving place. Our meal was over the top amazing. We ordered 6 or 7 small plates. Wine well paired for our meal by our attentive server. Cappuccino fantastic. My 2nd visit. They need a better hostess!"
Strider,"Dined on January 16, 2014",4,First experience with tapas. Food was excellent. The advice we received from the servers was spot on. The delivery of dishes was paced perfectly. This was a wonderful introduction to the world of tapas. We'll be back.
Kram62,"Dined on January 13, 2014",5,"Well, look no further than Casa Mono. Mouth watering delights to eat and perhaps one of the best Spanish wine lists in the country? Excellent service and delightful, helpful and knowledgeable sommelier. The only negative....smallish tables that are quite low....if you are over 6ft tall then bring knee pads!  But cannot wait to return....5ft 9""..."
Bobby,"Dined on January 13, 2014",5,Great place to get some good food you can not find anywhere else and also to meet some interesting people.
Carolyn,"Dined on January 13, 2014",4,"The food at Casa Mono is always top notch-- the right mix of classical spanish cooking and inventive, contemporary approach to good food. The servers are always competent and polite. It is a small place. Table space is tight, and though they do the best they can to make use of the space, you may end up sharing more of your neighbors' conversation and experience than you might wish. The food more than makes up for it, though."
Tamraepaz,"Dined on January 13, 2014",5,We have dined at Casa mono many times and each time is a different food experience as the menu changes frequently. The waiters are very knowledgeable pairing wines with chosen food. They specialize in small plates and sharing Great for special occasions as well as an everyday treat
gorm,"Dined on January 11, 2014",5,Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. Great atmosphere and even better food and wine!
Sweetbread,"Dined on January 10, 2014",5,"I have eaten here several times. I return because it is always good, even excellent at times. It is a great place to eat with a friend as then there are twice as many tastes - if she will share her scallops. When I have been on my own I have had a great contact with fellow eaters and with the cooks while sitting at the bar. I will return."
baby,"Dined on January 9, 2014",3,"Really great food, waiters don't care, if you ask for salt or olive oil they say yes and it never comes. Wait a long time for the waiter to take order and then they try to rush you out to turn over the table. Made for a mixed bag in dining experience."
MydaT,"Dined on January 6, 2014",5,"Went for lunch with my 2 adult daughters, both of whom love good food. Well, Casa Mono did not disappoint. Razor clams, confit of goat, bone marrow, all of which were worthy of plate licking. And with Estrella beer, we were very happy girls. This is one place I will return to when visiting NYC."
dp88514,"Dined on January 1, 2014",5,"best way to enjoy this gem is to sit and watch the chefs making the various plates, then pick the ones that are most appealing... No rush, no hurry, wonderful and caring service... A treat to observe and savour..."
FoodieJC,"Dined on December 31, 2013",5,"We went here on December 23 and had a phenomenal experience with a group of 4. Upon arriving at the restaurant, we were informed our table was not yet ready and were invited to wait in Bar Jamon, the wine bar. We waited for about 20 minutes and the bartender at the wine bar came over to us informing us our table was not yet ready, but for our inconvenience they had sent us a plate of jamon iberico - well handled!!! Everything we tried once seated was exquisite with the standouts for the group being the duck egg, pig's ears, the bone marrow and the rabbit. One member of our party actually tried 7 new things that night and enjoyed all of them! Great spot. Can't wait to return!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 29, 2013",3,"The tables are way too small for the restaurant proposal. We had to order many plates that wouldn't fit the table size. The tables were so close that we had to make an really big effort to be able to seat down, especially with all the coats, bags, scarves..."
JavierB,"Dined on December 28, 2013",5,Very happy we picked casa mono for a special occasion - the food was delicious and we felt transported to Spain. I've been to Spain a few time and this is the closest in taste and environment I have found in the city. A bit expensive but worth it!
Comelon,"Dined on December 24, 2013",4,We eat out on a regular basis and have eaten in numeous restaurants around the world. The food here was fantastic especially the rabbit. The wine menu was extensive. It took a while to seat us even though tables were visibly open and we had a reservation. But once we sat down the process was orderly. Got lots of help on the wines. Tables could have been a bit bigger. I was suprised at how small the restaurant is. We will come back and will take friends over when they visit NYC and ask what is new and good!
Amazing,"Dined on December 23, 2013",5,Wine list is a little hard to decipher but the food is incredible!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 22, 2013",5,Amazing food. Will definitely return.
LGeats,"Dined on December 18, 2013",5,Went here for a birthday dinner for my fiancé. We ordered six different plates. Every single one was excellent and delicious. The two desserts we had were always outstanding making the entire experience a special one. Dinners here are expensive but well worth the cost.
montrealer,"Dined on December 7, 2013",3,"We went there to celebrate my birthday.  We had a reservation at 10h and arrived at 10h10. We were immediatly told they were about to give away our table, and repeteadly told they only keep the tbale 20 minutes after the reservation. We were there 10 min late. My friend was smoking outside, we were told she had to come in immediatetly to be seated. this was our first 2 minutes in.  The waiter was extremely indifferent to us and our demands. Never cracked a smile. When we told him it was my birthday and we were there from Montréal to celebrate it there and it was very special, the waiter barely acknowledge us and told us his shift was ending.  We were very disappointed with the service and the lack of friendliness of the staff."

Kristie,"Dined on December 6, 2013",4,"I have been here several times so know and expect the cramped dining room. Every single dish is very good, right down to the simple pan con tomate. I love all the different meats they offer as well. The only problem with my last dining experience here was with a 7pm reservation we were only allowed the table for 2 hours, I wish they would tell you that when you reserve a table, my group of 3 were not even offered a dessert menu and were hastily told to leave when the 9:00 reservation arrived. So, this is NOT a place for a leisurely dinner to drink, eat and catch up with friends."
Foodie,"Dined on December 4, 2013",4,For lunch or dinner the food here is consistently extraordinary and still worth it when it is very loud (not always).
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 3, 2013",5,one word: AMAZING! Always a good place to celebrate a special occasion. And so far I've always taken my husband here for his birthday.
tixy,"Dined on December 2, 2013",4,I really enjoyed this place. The menu is very unique and all is delicious! Everything was perfect I just wasn't happy they dropped a check at 6 pm on Sunday without checking if we want anything else. If the server waited another minute we would have asked for it :) so it spoiled the impression just a little.
SS82,"Dined on December 1, 2013",5,"My husband and I were visiting NYC for the weekend. Had dinner at Casa Mono on Saturday night after a friend's recommendation. We were not disappointed! The food was outstanding, the service was flawless and the wine list was great (I know nothing about Spanish wines but our server's suggestions were great!). The restaurant is tiny and pretty jammed but it just adds to the atmosphere. We had an absolutely fantastic experience at Casa Mono"
amocomida,"Dined on November 30, 2013",5,One of the best restaurants in the city. Complex flavors. Consistent. Great wine.
SajaTourbah,"Dined on November 27, 2013",5,"Ever since discovering this place, it is a go to every time I'm in New York. Perfect sized plates since all the dishes are absolutely amazing. Very Interesting flavor combinations cooked to perfection!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 26, 2013",1,"We were completely disappointed in the service at casa mono. The food was fine, nothing special but the service ruined the whole experience for us. The hostess and manager were terrible for business and rude to paying customers. Our server was very nice but the hostess and manager were the first people we saw and they set the tone for the whole evening. I would never go back there nor reccomend it to anyone."
SteveBeau,"Dined on November 25, 2013",4,Great food and good vibe. Veal was fantastic!
STXER,"Dined on November 25, 2013",4,"Went to Casa Mono expecting just another tapas restaurant. This one is way different. It's tiny, I sat at the counter just a few feet from 4 chefs watching them turn out delicious dishes. A very friendly vibe here and thee service was perfect. Can't wait to go back!"
R7898,"Dined on November 25, 2013",5,"Food and service is excellent. Restaurant is very small and a number of tables are very tight. On a cold day you freeze when the door opens, unless you have enough of the wonderful wine to warm you up. It is a fun place, particularly for foodies. Very interesting dishes and combinations. And they all work. We have been here many times and food is consistently excellent. We will be back."
constanteater,"Dined on November 24, 2013",4,"The wine list was outstanding, great variety and selection, However a number of the itrems are rather overpriced Also the locati0on was a bit difficult to find. Not well lit."
meateaterlovesavegan,"Dined on November 24, 2013",3,"This restaurant is open until 2am, so it is ideal after a show. The food is just ok though. For my taste, the dishes were quite salty and each dish had one unnecessary ingredient that took away from the flavors. The servers did a nice job trying to accommodate my vegan boyfriend, so that was a plus."
SydneyFoodie,"Dined on November 24, 2013",5,"Fantastic food. It was refreshing to visit a restaurant that embraces ownership of their products and uses nose to tail concepts within their menu. We were impressed by every disc that we sampled.  Great Spanish wine list.  Service was good, but not amazing. As is to be expected in a very busy, small restaurant.  Casa Mono is small and packed, so gets very noisy. Not really the place to take kids. Go early if you can to avoid the rush.  We'll be back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 22, 2013",5,"We've been to Casa Mono many times because the food is so spectacular but this time the service was so bad, the attitude dismissive. We were greeted without a smile, no effort to accommodate our request (for another table), the waiter showed up when he needed to, never asked how our meal was, made no effort to explain the specials of the day, just almost threw down (put down?) the sheet of paper with specials on our table and walked away. I was actually astounded and didn't want to make a fuss because it was a special occasion and I didn't want to ruin the evening but the service at Casa Mono almost did that on its own."
Mich,"Dined on November 20, 2013",3,"This restaurant is okay - not bad but not great. I live a few blocks away and had intended on trying it a long time ago but never got around to it until this week. It's super small and always packed so I had high expectations. The menu is unique and has a variety of options however, the prices are very high for the tiniest tapas I've ever seen. I also didn't particularly care for the waiter pressing us to order more than we wanted at 9:45pm, which is quite late to eat heartily. We ordered a tapa per person plus a few sides, a 2nd round of wine, and dessert. Our waiter informed us more than once that we were ordering lightly and treated us as though he didn't appreciate our business. I will take my business elsewhere next time."
Faile,"Dined on November 17, 2013",4,"Great place to go to sample a variety of small plates, for two diners we ordered four and were pleased with quality (but weren't exactly full afterward!). Lots of interesting and well-made dishes on the menu, although we felt the rabbit was rather overpowered by the sauce. Leg of lamb with salted chocolate was fantastic, though. Order a variety of things to share and you should be pretty happy!"

LovetoEat,"Dined on November 14, 2013",4,I have been to Casa Mono several times. My only complaint is the lack of space between diners and the slightly nauseating clientele that frequents the establishment. Sometimes you just have to put up with loud talkers and clueless people and just enjoy the food and drink.
Foodie512,"Dined on November 10, 2013",4,"The food was very good. Creative dishes and pairings. Good service as well. The only drawback which will probably keep me from returning is the space. It is way too small to accommodate that many tables. We were sitting on top of another table and we could hear each other's conversation even though the noise level is fairly extreme. In addition, the wait staff kept bumping into my chair as they were trying to get through. My sweater fell on the floor twice and my purse (which was hanging on the back of my chair) kept banging into me. In warm weather, however, they do have outdoor seating which would cut down on noise but probably wouldn't resolve the space issue."
ChrisinLondon,"Dined on November 9, 2013",5,Our first time. 6 excellent dishes and very good wine. A bit noisy. But we liked the originality of the food (e.g. goat confit) as well as the quality of the cooking
downtowner,"Dined on November 6, 2013",5,We had not been here for a while and were surprised to realize that they have been around almost 10 years! the place is getting better! The fideos with manila clams and chorizo was memorable. I could eat it again right now. Lamb with chocolate sauce was unique and terific. The morcilla and tongue was spectacular. Though the wine list seems daunting there are several well priced reds. Ask the extremely helpful staff for assistance. Too bad the place is so small. It is not conducive to lingering or coming with a large group. We will be back again soon.
jlw1234567,"Dined on November 4, 2013",3,"Great food, awful service. Waited 20 minutes after being seated for the waiter to take our drink order, and another 20 to order food after wine was delivered. Great wine and great food but would not return because of the service."

GerP,"Dined on October 31, 2013",5,"Could have been a nightmare experience. Had reservations for 8:30 and upon arrival was told, ""we are running behind."" But after a short wait, we had one of the best meals during out NYC trip. The host was appropriately apologetic - and offered us a glass of Cava to ease the pain of our wait. We were given a table tucked in the corner away from the energetic crowd. The waiter was great - we ordered - bone marrow (the best); scallops, calamares, octopus, lamb belly -- stayed away from what seemed usual. All was excellent. The waiter recommended a moderately priced Basque, white wine, which was perfect as it cleansed the palette after each bite. Advice is to be adventurous and bold in your ordering -- and order the Basque wine!"
GregFoodie1,"Dined on October 31, 2013",4,"First time dining at Casa Mono, and while the dining room is a little cramped, the array of delicious, crave-able dishes were first-rate. Interesting ingredient combinations, luscious flavors (cauliflower puree with uni!), an incredibly creamy burratta with anchovies, a perfectly spicy rabbit, super flavorful quail/coxcomb/mushroom combo and a spectacular crema catalana for dessert -- just a few of the evening's highlights. Plus, the service was attentive, and the servers were genuinely excited about sharing the Casa Mono experience with first-timers. And finally the General Manager, Miguel, was extremely welcoming and attentive to all our needs. Can't wait to return and try other dishes!"

Venus,"Dined on October 28, 2013",5,"We just got back from Barcelona and, after a few days, were already craving for tapas and the Recadero cava. The food at Casa Mono was really good, albeit not entirely traditional Catalan. It is also a tad salty, which is usually the case in all Batali and Bastianich restaurants. The expensive iberico ham was not properly sliced and was a disappointment. All in all, Casa Mono delivered a very good dining experience."

Sarahreview,"Dined on October 18, 2013",3,This was my favourite restaurant when I last visited New York. I took my parents here on our last visit and was disappointed. The service was fair at best but the waiter have the impression we were a chore and it was difficult getting anyone's attention all night. The food was good but only one dish we ordered (the duck) was amazing.
Princessmimi,"Dined on October 17, 2013",5,We return to this restaurant as often as possible. The authentic Spanish tapas are outstanding.

Selina,"Dined on October 9, 2013",4,"Casa Mona can be quite noisy and busy on certain nights, but it is a good hot spot and their food is great. We waited at their side bar next door and even that was crowded. We had some jamon and vino before sitting down for a formal dinner. Brian, our waitress, was very good to us. I would definitely go back."
mayonaka,"Dined on October 6, 2013",4,"The fiance and I had and loved the popular dish - razor clams. We were so amazed to find that the dish was better than the razor clams we had in Barcelona. Moving right on, we then had pulpo with fennel and grapefruit. The way how they pan fried the squid was...just tasty! We also had the skirt steak and the duck breast instead. Even though the dishes were only slightly larger than tapas portion, the combination of sauce and protein is enough to get us full. Again, both dishes were delicious and well executed. For the dessert, we had their new item on the menu - pear and mascarpone. It was so refreshing that we left the restaurant wanting more....will come back soon enough for some more razor clams."
graphicguy69,"Dined on October 6, 2013",5,"Casa Mono was exceptional. Our server was really helpful in building a dinner of 6 items to share. Standouts were the Razor Clams and the Duck Egg. Room is small and gets noisy, but to see the open kitchen working away and enjoying a delicious meal was well worth the noise"
JAD538,"Dined on October 3, 2013",5,"We started with the pumpkin croquettes and a glass of sparkling wine (on the house, after my wife, who was very hungry had a hissy fit when we weren't seated on time for our reservation). Next up: burratta with grilled peach, honey, and a crouton - best cheese dish ever, hands down (although my wife still prefers the ricotta at Locanda Verde). The fluke crudo was so rich it blended perfectly with the spicy gazpacho sauce. Then the final appetizer: paella croquetas with uni. I can't describe it.  We then had 3 meat dishes: a goat dish my wife loved but I thought was only very good, duck breast that i thought was the best duck I ever had outside of Peking Duck House, and braised Beef Cheeck so sweet we decided that it would be dessert."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 25, 2013",4,Tiny spot but delicious food & wine.
Dan2028,"Dined on September 22, 2013",4,"I have always loved Casa Mono. The blend of flavours are superb, the dishes are inventive and the ingredients are fresh.  I have a few favourites; sweetbreads, foie gras and the skirt steak and have notice the portion sizes getting smaller and smaller. This recent visit, the sweetbreads looked like a half portion. No joke.  So it was a little disappointing."

Foodisfun,"Dined on September 20, 2013",3,Have eaten here twice and both times felt the service was very rushed. Too much food delivered all at once. We had to ask that one of our dishes be taken back and kept warm while we finished three others that had already been delivered. We love the small plate concept but it just wasn't executed well. Probably will not try it a third time.
Mediocre,"Dined on September 19, 2013",4,Small and crowded but vibrant. Food is very unique and tasty on th most part. The goat cheese croquettes were kinda bland but everything else we had was delicious. Waiter was non descript but not offensive. Nice part of NYC.

Pete,"Dined on September 6, 2013",5,"Casa Mono is a small tapas bistro with delightful creations and lots of flare. The seafood dishes were my favorite, particularly the razor clams. The cocktails were also creative and delicious. The only down side is that music was a bit too loud for dinner conversation."
CruzanGold,"Dined on September 3, 2013",4,"Casa Mono is a gem. The menu has so many delicious items that it is hard to choose. There are dishes for everyone. I recommend that you order lots of dishes and share. Do not miss the Chocolate, creme fraiche, sel de Mer. fpr dessert. Yummmm."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 31, 2013",5,"Excellent food, Great atmosphere. Attentive service. Small space."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 31, 2013",5,"Casa Mono is tiny, bustling, elbow to elbow kind of place that might initially make you wary that you will be pushed through the dining process in order to turn the tables rapidly. You would be wrong on this score, however, as the restaurant takes the leisurely Spanish pace for the course of the meal, and the food is really spectacular. On a recent outing we had some tried and true Casa Mono staples like the fried sardines and a fluke crudo, which were perfect as always, but we also had a confit of goat, a bit of crusty, savory perfection which was the favorite of the night, and oxtail stuffed piquillo peppers that were sublimely good."
Blair,"Dined on August 30, 2013",4,I have been here with different group of people for many times in past six months. Still want to dine here again and again.
sjshanno,"Dined on August 28, 2013",3,"I liked Casa Mono well enough but I won't be going back. Nothing wrong or bad about the food, service, ambiance etc. but the tiny space had me feeling continually cramped (I'm 6'3"") and more than anything else, simply a value for the dollar versus other choices in NYC. I will absolutely say that food was well-prepared, presented and was definitely very pleasing. If you are a foodie you will definitely enjoy Casa Mono."
Stearman,"Dined on August 23, 2013",3,"Cramped dining area, outrageous prices, even by nyc standards. The food will not disapoint. Delicious. The quantity might. Especially since they are a tappas restaurant. Barely enough on each plate for three people. You have to order five plates for a light lunch, add beer,wine and20% tip and youll be out two hundred bucks. Ive had as good for less around Union Square."
Marie,"Dined on August 21, 2013",4,"Food here is fantastic! But the place is not for a group (6). We had a 9:15 pm reservation, and they gave us a table at 9:53. We will go back but we will think twice before inviting people to join us (a couple) ."
AlexandraJ,"Dined on August 21, 2013",2,"I had such high hopes for Casa Mono, as I hold Batali to a very high standard (as we all should!), and as his restaurants and Spanish tapas are among my two favorite things. But this restaurant was a major disappointment. First of all, the menu is not authentic Spanish tapas. It's just somewhat-Spanish/pan-European/""new American"" food in tiny portions so that they can be called ""tapas."" Second of all, the food is just so-so. Nothing special. Ordered five different dishes, none of them really stood out, the best was the fluke crudo, but it wasn't special. Finally, the prices are absurd. I am happy to pay up for an excellent dining experience, but here, where the food was not special, and the portions tiny, the prices were ridiculous."
AnneS,"Dined on August 18, 2013",2,"The place was bustling on a Saturdsy night. Even though I had read that the restaurant was small I was still surprised by the size. Restaurant called twice to confirm the reservation on two different days. The food was delicious; the pumpkin and goat cheese croquettes were just ok. With the exception of the sommelier, the service was rushed and our server was gruff with a stiff demeanor. If you want a slower paced dining experience you won't get it. Server asked ""are you ready to order""at least three times and once the check was given came over to the table three times to see if were ready to pay. The seating was extremely uncomfortable and the table(school desk) was too small."
RandyS,"Dined on August 11, 2013",2,We had reservations yet they put three people at a table for two. Waiter was inattentive and two of the cuts of meat ordered were extremely fatty and undercooked.
Luvgdfood,"Dined on August 9, 2013",4,The food was excellent and the overall atmosphere was great. Waiting staff and bartender next door were a bit rude but waiting staff were very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu itself. Certainly wont disappoint if you love great/creative food!

Junnyc,"Dined on August 3, 2013",4,Nice brunch place while enjoying saturday. Decent dishes and wines. Each dishes were good enough to make me re-visit later. Hope to try other kinds of dishes with nice weather. Confidentially recommend to my friend for casual brunch place.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 3, 2013",5,"Casa Mono is a very small Tapas restaurant, which is always packed! It's always hard to get a dinner reservation on weekends so plan ahead.  They recommend ordering 2~3 tapas dishes per person. My personal favorite was the duck egg dish."
ZoeB,"Dined on August 3, 2013",3,"My husband and I loved the ambiance, we had a great bottle of wine. the tapas were all well presented and absolutely""Delish"". I appreciated the decor of the place. Great Spanish music playing. I will definitely will go back."
Geezy,"Dined on July 30, 2013",5,"This place is amazing!! I don't know who comes up with the menu but it is genius!!! Pumpkin and goat cheese, beets and manchengo, soft crab with bacon aioli, and fluke with watermelon, and strawberries and cucumber. Delicisio!!"
AgnesK,"Dined on July 27, 2013",2,"Came back after an amazing first time... Maybe it was because we went on a Fri night, but, whatever it was, everything was lacking. The foie that we received was very scant in comparison to the first visit. The bone marrow was maybe left on the hardtop too long because half of it was dry to the point of there being no marrow. The razor clams will always be my favorite here though."
Tomomot,"Dined on July 25, 2013",3,"Food was great and wine pouring was generous. However we weren't completely satisfied about waiter's service. He ""suggest"" us that we (5 of us, not so big eater Asian women) should order at least 2 or 3 plates each and the order have to be done at once (with adjust timing). We thought it's too much so ordered 8 or 9. Those dish are even over $15 each, he complained saying it's not enough and seems very unhappy. Yes, it was plenty of food, anyway. If it's restaurant's policy, we hope it should've been written somewhere."
RoseC,"Dined on July 25, 2013",3,We where seated for our 5pm reservation and waiting for one more person in our party and we where told by the lady manger to remember that there was a 7 pm reservation after us. Then she proceeded to say that we needed to be finished by then. P.S. we where done with Tapas by 6 but decided not to order dessert because we felt watched and hurried. It was not a pleaseat experience. The waiter was apologetic because it wasn't his fault.
tpc83,"Dined on July 24, 2013",4,Tapas style excellent variety Wine selection eclectic and excellent
gregg,"Dined on July 22, 2013",4,the food is a knockout. the service leaves something to be desired.
Lovelylady,"Dined on July 21, 2013",5,"We had a girls weekend in NYC and decided to go to Casa Mono for dinner. Service was incredible, the servers were helpful with the menu and offering suggestions for the wine list. The hostess was very attentive and was flexible with the change in the number of diners. The food was incredible and very well thought out. Classic Spanish flavors. The only downside was it is very small and can get quite loud. Overall a wonderful night!"
Gyro13,"Dined on July 19, 2013",4,"My girlfriend had been out of town and upon her return I wanted to treat her to something special. After checking the Michelin guide, casa mono looked like a great fit due to the Tapas style cuisine and location. We were seated immediately (even though we arrived 10 min early - awesome!) and selected a bottle of wine and 5 plates. Food and beverage were great! Our waitress was friendly but bus staff was frequently bumping us and interrupting at bad times (ie intimate moments). Also the noise level was really high and the table is not meant for larger humans (FYI if you are an avg size male - my legs were cramped and I'm only 5'11""). Overall would definitely return!"
battistini,"Dined on July 18, 2013",2,"the food is great, but, the service was not, our waitress was characterless and seemed to be totally disengaged. the tables are far too small and the table setting was not the cleanest. the stemware was streaked and cloudy, plates felt as if they'd been washed in cold or luke warm water."
FitchburgDrJohn,"Dined on July 14, 2013",5,"Many of the wines - all Spanish - were unfamiliar to us. The waiter and somellier were very knowledgeable and helped us pair the wines with the intriguing ""small plates"". The wine list features numerous choices by the glass and bottle, with tastes and prices to appeal to all palates and budgets. The ""small plates"" also provide opportunity to experience foods not frequently available. I particularly enjoy sweetbreads, and they were very well done here. The three of us had eleven selections (inclusive of dessert) among us, and all were wonderful. Where else have you had olive oil ice cream? If you are looking for steak and potatoes, this is not the place for you; if you are looking to be transported to somewhere new and different, it is."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 14, 2013",5,Ansolutely delicious. One of the best experiences for unique dining in the city. Incredible value.
DeeDee,"Dined on July 8, 2013",4,"It'd been a while since we had been to the restaurant. I was not disappointed dining at the restaurant. They had a couple of our favorites, delicious as we remembered. Oxtail stuffed peppers and the steak with romesco sauce are standouts. The waitress was very knowledgable regarding the food and the wine. Her recommendation for wine was spot on. The dishes are somewhat smaller than we had in Spain, so order accordingly. I recommend Casa Mono without reservation."
gmp216,"Dined on July 7, 2013",5,"I've been coming here for years and have never had a disappointing dish. One of the rare New York restaurants at this level that has maintained a consistently high quality. They continue to vary the menu but my old favorites, like the oxtail stuffed piquillo peppers, are still there. Evenings can be busy so stop in for a late lunch on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 6, 2013",4,"the food is very good, although they do not use a very spanish way of doing things... go to tertulia for a more spaniard taste, but still the ingredients are very good and the food is very good. the place is small and cozy and people are very nice. expensive though, i guess ok for ny standard. not for spaniard standard."
Rye20Foodie,"Dined on July 3, 2013",4,"Food is good, well prepared, staff is nice. The place is hot though, and noisy."
BethR,"Dined on June 27, 2013",2,"We had 4 small plates which were fine for dinner for two but the food was really inconsistent and so disappointing. The cod cheeks were way too fishy (not typical for cod!) and definitely too salty; we even contemplated sending it back. The peppers stuffed with oxtail ragu was probably the best dish but just very good, tasty but nothing special. The squid was also good but the grits were too salty and uninspired. While the octopus was excellent it was a small part of the plate and the rest again was uninspired. All in all, not at all what we were expecting. Having been to Amada in Philadelphia several times, we'll stick to Philly for our expensive tapas where the food is amazing!"
ak1181,"Dined on June 26, 2013",5,What can I say - I have never had a bad meal here - I love Casa Mono. I freqent this restaurant more than any other in the city. Food and service are consistently great and the restaurant itself is a pleasure in which to dine - I recommend at least one time sitting at the bar in front of the open kitchen - its great fun to watch the meals pepared. Ingredients are top notch and the dishes are creative and well executed. Personal favorites - the pulpo and fideos.
JackieM,"Dined on June 25, 2013",4,"excellent food and service, cozy lively decor, but extremely noisy, can't carry on a conversation"
Excook,"Dined on June 22, 2013",5,such a cool small restaurant. food is exceptional with excellent Spanish wine list. Brian Williams is a great waiter.
Nice,"Dined on June 21, 2013",2,"We Dined at 4 well known restaurants on this trip and Casa was disappointing in its food, service and ambiance. The open kitchen design was interesting but the food failed to live up to expectations. We also had a poor experience with the host and then subsequently the manager. The area has numerous restaurants so it might be best to check out one of them."
Luv2eat,"Dined on June 21, 2013",5,Great food you won't find very many places outside of Spain. Also has some great eclectic Spanish wines that you've never heard of or had. Well worth the visit.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 20, 2013",2,"I'll never go back. Dishes are too oily. The Fideos with Chorizo and clams used to be made with cockles. They now make it with huge clams. We only got 4 in the dish and the clams were VERY sandy. The peppers stuffed with oxtail had bone or something unidentified that was hard in it. The razor clams were still good, but you put that much garlic and oil on anything, it will taste good. The potatas bravas were so oily we didn't eat them. The soft shell crab was too salty but otherwise cooked ok. The pork croquetas were undercooked and inedible. The best part of the meal was waiting for our table at Bar Jamon next door and eating the chorizo, manchego and jamon iberico. I would go back to bar jamon, not to Casa Mono."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 19, 2013",5,"I'm always excited to see what is on the menu and never disappointed. Thankfully, their small plates make it possible to sample a few dishes because its always hard to choose!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 15, 2013",5,Felt like I was in Barcelona... Food & service were excellent.
Teacupsugarqueen,"Dined on June 14, 2013",5,Totally unprepared for the extraordinary! Foods prepared to be photo worthy and delicious beyond words! My first time in the restaurant and I will be become a regular! Fabulous combinations of perfectly grilled asparagus with a runny cool egg along with blue cheese and other secrets was heaven on a plate. Perfectly grilled sardines or generous portions of razor clams blew me off the map! A menu filled with unique and brilliant combinations for the real foodie. I wish I lived next door rather than across town.
Diner,"Dined on June 14, 2013",4,"This is a great restaurant- once you get to the table. The food is delicious, wait staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. However the hostess staff is disorganized and fairly rude. They called me 3 times to confirm my reservation even though I confirmed on the first call. My husband was 5 mins late and the hostess told me that they had another table coming after us and we'd have to be out - several times, quite rudely. Throughout our entire dinner and when we left there were empty tables and no one waiting."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 13, 2013",5,i have eaten lunch here 5 times over the past 2 years and they have been extremely consistent with the quality and taste of the food....great job!!!! and i look forward to going back
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 13, 2013",4,The fried squid with broken egg was delish!
Alisa,"Dined on June 13, 2013",5,This is my favorite restaurant in NYC. The Foie Gras Cinco Cebollas is beyond words. Of course there are a great many delicious things on the menu. I've never had anything mediocre there. It IS very small so prepare to be intimate with those in neighboring tables. You'll forget you're on some stranger's lap when the food arrives.
Adventurer,"Dined on June 10, 2013",4,"Wanted to catch up with my daughter, who's off to Africa for six months, and a foodie- great on all counts- un pressured, knowledgeable friendly staff, interesting food and wine options, and comfortable surroundings in great neighborhood- thanks Casa Mono!"
kryanl2002,"Dined on June 9, 2013",4,"The food was delicious! The baby squid dish was amazing and I highly recommend it to everyone! The presentation of the dishes was excellent. All the food looked so beautiful. The only complaints I have was the size of the restaurant. It was so tiny, getting up from the table was extremely difficult. Also, because it was tiny, the noise level seemed amplified. But the food more than made up for that!"
Monika,"Dined on June 7, 2013",5,"Read some of the reviews and was a bit apprehensive--> However, Casa Mono was a great Tapas place with the wait staff as nice and knowledgeable as in the other of Mario's places. The lamb and baby octopus plates are quite generous and are to die for. Not your typical tapas place with mini portions of 1-2 bites! Yes, it is a small place, but not uncomfortable since all the other diners were also cognizant of their close neighbors. It felt like some of the neighborhood places in Southern Europe."
Twiggy,"Dined on June 5, 2013",4,"Casa Mono has terrific food with great variety for everyone from diehard meat eaters to vegans. Although it is quite small and can feel crowded even when it isn't full, it is a great choice on a temperate day because the floor-to-ceiling windows are flown open, and you feel as if you are eating outdoors without being on the sidewalk. It can be deceptively pricey, because you aren't always sure how much food to order, and it adds up -- not just in price but in a feeling of fullness. If you do not want to overeat, ask your waitperson how many dishes to order, and then order one less. It's easy and quick enough to add another if you and your companion(s) are hungry."
DXCSF,"Dined on June 4, 2013",2,"what was most disappointing was that the service was so indifferent. With Batali's big personality and the warm service I've experienced at most other Batali restaurants, this really threw the whole experience off. No one on the staff was engaging to us in any way, or even engaging with each other, and really acted as if they were just at any job. For a restaurant from a big name, charging prices like they do, this doesn't cut it."
Foodyholic,"Dined on June 3, 2013",4,"This tapas place doesn't serve the usual tapas found everywhere else in the city which is why I like it. They also always have new specials in the menu. But my favorites are: the duck egg with truffle oil, razor clams, fideos, and the catalan creme brulee with the batter dipped fried bay leaf that you rip the crispy batter out off."
jjnewyorktourist,"Dined on June 1, 2013",4,"We had a nice lunch in this cozy spot. Be prepared to be squeezed in quite comfily. The small restaurant was perfect for getting together over a few tapas and wine to chat. The only drawback was the lack of legroom at our table (we were squeezed up in front). Otherwise, excellent food and great service."
BesteNanNan,"Dined on June 1, 2013",4,"We love the food at Casa Mono and it can be fun in the evenings with the energetic crowd, but it is often hard to carry a conversation and it seems the food comes all at once, and dinner is over way too soon! But if you arrive at noon when they open on Saturday, the room is yours and gradually fills as you are finishing a leisurely meal. The food is top notch!! I could rave about a dozen dishes - but I have the best artichoke hearts on the planet there! Thanks for the memories! I'll be back!"
John,"Dined on May 28, 2013",4,"Food was pretty good. Did not like having to order all dishes up front. To me tapas are order as you go. Also tables were way to tight. I would go back, however, and now know what to expect"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 25, 2013",4,The food here is great along with an extensive wine list. The only draw back is the size of the restaurant. It's very tight and cramped.
anvasqu,"Dined on May 25, 2013",3,"I had high expectations for this restaurant. The food was good, nothing stellar, and the service left a lot to be desired."
Foodisfun,"Dined on May 25, 2013",5,"We loved the small plates and sharing style of eating. There were so many unusual dishes to try, we can't wait to go back and order more. The soft shell crab was excellent, as well as the goat livers we tried. All very good and nicely presented. My only complaint is that we were 20 minutes late for our 6:00 reservation (raining in NY, couldn't get a cab, took subway and got lost). We called twice to say we were on our way and we were told both on the phone and when we got there that our table was reserved at 8:00 so we had a time limit. Now I get the problem but I did think it was rude for the hostess to basically reprimand us for being late. We stayed any way and didn't worry about time but we could tell our food was somewhat rushed."
slee,"Dined on May 24, 2013",4,"I came here for lunch with my coworkers so I cannot give a good impression on their notable wine list though I heard it was pretty great. We ordered 8 different small plates off their menu and all were superb. I would definitely like to go back to try their wine one of these nights. I've tried before but this small space gets very crowded, a sign of a great restaurant/bar I suppose! Will definitely be coming back. Thanks!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 23, 2013",5,"Found the dishes--both small plate and entree-- inventive and delicious. Flavors enhanced each ingredient. Nice delicate touch with seafood. Cost adds up, but well worth it for a dining experience that transports you out of New York to enjoy relaxation for a few hours in Spain. Went three days after first visit to ensure other friends could experience as well. On my short list now for all NY trips."
Jessi,"Dined on May 21, 2013",5,"We ordered 5 dishes. Foie Gras, Razor clams and calamares were absolutely amazing, especially the foie gras with five onion sweet and sour sauce, perfect combination. definitely go back again."
JuliaL,"Dined on May 19, 2013",3,"I was excited to come back to Casa Mono after a 3 year absense. I was surprised to learn that the restaurant requires each table to place its full order at one time. This ""rule"" seemed counter to the tapas experience. With that said, we had a delicious meal with the exception of the Cod Cheeks (more about a texture than taste) and the Sommelier although he could barely smile did recommend a terrific wine."
NYC81,"Dined on May 18, 2013",2,"Tapas weren't that great. The waiter was not helpful in making a wine selection. Better food, better and more intimate ambiance, and better service can be found next door, at Casa Mono's offshoot Bar Jamon."

FilmFan,"Dined on May 16, 2013",3,Excellent food; small restaurant with close tables. Very loud music -- not a good place for easy conversation.
leec21,"Dined on May 7, 2013",4,"First of all, I would like to say the food there was great. We ordered razor clam, squid, scallop , rabbit meat and we love all of them. The only complaint we have is their hostess. We were 10 minutes late (I had a long day walking in New York and can't walk too fast) and hostess said she can't seat us because we are late and it is a ""protocol"" to prevent her from seating us. ""There will be full of people in next twenty minutes"", she claimed. So we deiced to seat at bar. The next one to two hours we observed the restaurant and found there are plenty enough seats available.... Overall this is a great place for foodies but don't be late (not even a bit) because it is a ""protocol""."
jopopo,"Dined on May 3, 2013",3,"Lunchtime -service was pleasant but spotty and slow. We shared razor clams - the flavors were spot-on, but they were really gritty. Also a nice salad with anchovies - tasty if not memorable. We also had an enjoyable goat confit and a duo of lamb. The lamb was very mediocre. The chop was way overcooked. If it had benn mine rather than my husband's, I'd have sent it back. Even so, there was nothing special about the lamb - not really better than in many Greek restaurants. With one shared dessert and 2 coffees, this all came to $120, and in no way was it worth the expense. It's a very cute place that does feel very Spanish, and you could probably have a great meal there if you knew up front what was good, but we weren't so lucky."
MPEnjoy,"Dined on April 27, 2013",5,"Great perfectly sized, innovative and flavorful tapas!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 26, 2013",5,As always Casa Mono is a wonderful evening of great food!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 25, 2013",5,"Was so delicious - everything!...we had a lamb chop/belly special that was excellent. When the chef overheard my sister ask for two chops instead of belly - he agreed but added that we ""didn't know what we were missing!""....we were sold, but the really classy part of the story was that this chef sent over two chops and the lamb belly --- completely unexpected surprise....great energy, great food!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 23, 2013",4,Bone marrow was awesome! The place is very small and cramped so this is a 2-3 party place.
Halche,"Dined on April 23, 2013",4,"Contrary to what I was led to expect by other reviewers, I found the service to be excellent and friendly. The food places an emphasis on the intense flavoring of dishes with a distinct but not overpowering smokey taste. I did not find the dishes overly salty. While it's true the restaurant is small and noisy, I had no difficulty carrying on a conversation with my dinner companion. The portions seemed reasonably sized and fairly priced. Between the two of us, we ordered five tapas plus dessert and could probably have gotten away with four tapas and dessert and felt completely sated. The glass of wine recommended by our waiter was outstanding. I highly recommend the restaurant for a night of exciting but casual dining."
Danzilla,"Dined on April 22, 2013",5,"The food was exotic and fantastic; going to have to go back and try all new plates. The rabbit, razor clam, and baby squid dishes were AMAZING. Well worth checking out."

NicoleS,"Dined on April 20, 2013",3,"Food was good, but I felt rushed and cramped during the meal. I was with a group of 6 and would definiteley not recommend going here with a group greater than 2 people - the space just isn't accommodating for that kind of crowd. The service was good but not excellent and the food was very good. The place was packed and if I go back, I will probably try sitting at the bar to avoid being at a table on top of other parties."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 19, 2013",5,My companion and I were so tempted by so many of the interesting menu items. everything was delicious and each dish served immediately when it was ready. Determined to go back and try a different selection each time

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 14, 2013",3,Food was good. Despite the fact we had a reservation late in the evening they made us wait 40 minutes. We almost left the place.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 12, 2013",3,"Worst service ever. Having lived in Manhattan nearly a decade and a half I'm used to coming across some quirky servers but ours took the cake that day. Our order wasn't taken for nearly fifteen minutes after we were seated, which I could understand if it was a crowded lunch, instead our server was busy giving a back rub to his colleague in the middle if the dining room. When he finally made the time to to stop by our table and take our order he refused to speak a single word- this continued throughout the meal - to the point where we were left wondering if he was mute - until we saw him chatting with a fellow server. The food here is consistently decent but I won't be back nor will I ever recommend this place after the horrific service"
HHeller,"Dined on April 10, 2013",3,Always a pleasure to eat at Casa Mono.Amazing how crowded it has been since day one.
ngmuipai,"Dined on April 7, 2013",5,"There are some very good tapas in NY right now -- Tia Pol, Txikito, Tertullia -- but Casa Mono remains at the top of the list. Problem is, the place is so small, it's really best for intimate groups, and that means you can't order everything on the menu, as you'd like."
roberto,"Dined on April 5, 2013",5,"good music, good service, good food, cheap price!!!!"
afon,"Dined on April 5, 2013",4,"the food at this place never fails to impress me, the problem is the size of the restaurant. it's really small, so if you're showing up with a party of three your different small plates won't fit on your table (go to the bar or find a fourth person so you can get a larger table)."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 4, 2013",5,"Amazing service, waitress made great recommendations! I'm adding this place to my ""must-visit"" list when in NYC!"

GThomas,"Dined on April 2, 2013",3,"This could be a great spot if the portions were at least 50% larger which is truly not saying much! The fish, lamb and other dishes were gone in two bites. For $14 or so it is reasonable, but you really need to order 2 of everything to fill up.  Lovely ambiance though....."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 30, 2013",4,Try Bar Jamon next door for a drink beforehand.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 29, 2013",5,"The tapas was beautifully presented, the food itelf well thought out, and delicious. We would highly recommend it.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 23, 2013",4,"We have tried their tapas bar next door( excellent) and decided to try the restaurant. Food was very good, wine list excellent, knowledgeable servers and quick service. Nice vibe inside given it's cramped quarters . Definitely a notch above."
mnyc,"Dined on March 18, 2013",4,"Food here is good, but not outstanding. At an average of around $17 per tapas plate, I would expect more. Service also leaves something to be desired. Go around the corner to Bar Jamon for less expensive but similar choices in food and wine."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 17, 2013",4,The dining area is very small and tight. The food and service was very good.
Mirasol,"Dined on March 16, 2013",2,"Perhaps we had bad luck, but I wasn't impressed with most of the dishes we had. The Foie Gras and beef tongue were good but nothing special. The pork belly was dry and overcooked. The rabbit dish was too salty. The Dorada with Clam Ceviche, however, was great. Service was good."
scottykeats,"Dined on March 16, 2013",1,Been to casa mono many time and the meal is usually excellent. Saturday night we had inedible fishy monkfish cheeks and other very salty food. We were totally disappointed
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 9, 2013",5,"Always wonderful! We were delighted to return and share with friends who'd never enjoyed!  Funny that in your options for vetting, considering 'noise' there is not the option for 'too loud' - which frankly is often the major problem! Casa Mono kindly did reduce the piped in sound level at our request!"
victorc,"Dined on March 4, 2013",2,"We have been to this restaurant several times and although we enjoy the food we will not go back. Reason is that the wine is way over priced, the portions I know this is tapas, but even so the price is high for the size. The place is tiny and crowded so it's not like you're paying for comfort. We have been to Spain and know the price of jamon but the skimpy plate they serve is still way overpriced for both quality and portion. Also the menu does not seem to have changed much since we first went, is this kitchen tired? There is way too much competition to be this complacent and expensive."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 1, 2013",5,"Great food. The Foi gras was excellent, The Kokokxas were excelent with a very good pil pil souce. The scallops very good A real good place with great food, wine list and ambiance"
betsy,"Dined on February 28, 2013",2,The maitre d' was unbelievably rude. WE had reservations and were told before we were even seated that we had to be out of there by 9:30. Service was friendly but inattentive. The food however was really wonderful.
Dilbert,"Dined on February 26, 2013",4,"Wonderful tapas, across the board-- felt like I was back in Barcelona!"
NMR123,"Dined on February 26, 2013",4,"Went here for dinner on a Monday night. Had requested a corner table near a window, and unfortunately was given a two top right in the middle of the restaurant. Also had to wait 15 min past Res time. Despite these letdowns, the ambiance was fantastic, the service attentive and personal, and the food/wine delicious. Would recommend to anyone looking for a romantic tapas spot."
whkc,"Dined on February 23, 2013",4,"Must try the razor clams. A little salty for my taste but I must admit the food was amazing. The place is a bit small/cramped but it provided a cozy environment overall. Went with a friend and ordered 5 tapas, perfect portion."
londonman,"Dined on February 22, 2013",4,"A wonderful location on Irving Place - one of those quiet streets in Manhattan. Loved everything, except was disappointed about the portion size of the polpi. Very expensive for polpi and very little on the plate!"
grettam,"Dined on February 20, 2013",5,"fantastic food. Go early. wehen it gets crowded, it is exceptionally noisy and the tables are very close together."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 18, 2013",4,"Excellent for folks with diverse tastes, comfortable with a New York dining experience. Somewhat spendy but not excessively so. Your Midwestern relatives will feel cramped in the tight space and rely heavily on patatas bravas to feel sated. Whether these issues are flaws of the restaurant or the diner are a matter of perspective, but as in all matters of dining, ""know your audience"" is a good place to start in seeking a satisfactory experience."
LidiaR,"Dined on February 17, 2013",2,"Awful careless hipster-attitude female server. The food was super salty and over cooked. We were never asked if we were enjoying the dinner.The wine and plum ice-cream dessert were out of control. Although we did get some Dessert wine on the house when we complained on the food, it doesn't change the dissappinting experience we had to go through. I will spread the word and not recommend this place to anyone. I know this place is still going to be succeful and busy but I will never be back to this pretentious environment spot with unattentive service and not impressive food. What a shame, Batali, what a shame!"
StacyJ,"Dined on February 15, 2013",5,"I love this restaurant! I have been here a handful of times, alone, with my husband, with friends, summer, winter and fall, and it is always a good scene. Not romantic but intimate in that you will be almost sitting in the laps of your neighboring diners. The food is wonderful and comforting. The staff is knowledgeable and warm (if you allow it), from food to wine and anything in between."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 14, 2013",4,"very flavorful food, a bit on the salty side, but I have heard that is how many Batali restaurants tend to be. great wine"
jojo,"Dined on February 3, 2013",4,"Very tiny place but great food and sevice ,the wine selection was terrific. We plan on going back"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2013",2,"Any place that asks $20 plus per small plate and says they are a tapas restaurant should not put a time limit on the table. $350 for three of us and only 1hr 45min and we were asked to leave and that someone else had a reservation, not cool. Lost my business for good"
Excook,"Dined on February 2, 2013",4,had scallops and they were minute and only 4
AppleAnnie12,"Dined on January 29, 2013",4,Fabulous food in a too loud setting with postage size tables!
LaLa,"Dined on January 28, 2013",4,"Good food. Good service. The restaurant wasn't busy, so it's difficult to tell what it would be like when it is busy. There was 1 chef, so I don't know how she would be able to keep up if all the tables were full. Will definitely go back."
ynadal,"Dined on January 27, 2013",5,One of my favorites when in town. Food is ewquisite and the service is consistently great!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 26, 2013",4,"This small Restaurant has many excellent features. Professional, attentive waiters and superb food. Negatives: small tables, noisy, not cheap. Would definitely recommend, and most assuredly return."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 25, 2013",4,"The food is so fantastic (thinking first and foremost about the bacalao croquetas). However, the service is always a little disappointing - but I'll keep coming back for the food!"
HeidiP,"Dined on January 25, 2013",5,Truly my favourite restaurant in NY. I go for dinner on every trip. Spanish tapas done exceptionally well. Definitely lively so not your seen if you don't like noise. Seating is a bit cramped but it adds to the atmosphere!
Harald,"Dined on January 23, 2013",4,We had a great evening and the food was amazing. Will definetely come back.
RichardS,"Dined on January 21, 2013",5,"we had an excellent meal and a good, reasonably bottle of wine"
newyork,"Dined on January 21, 2013",1,This restaurant does not deserve michelin starred one at all. Most of all managing staff are not considered to be courteous . And they are very rude and busy in filling the seats without caring customers.
gail,"Dined on January 21, 2013",4,"Enjoyed a very rich meal here after a glass of Spanish wine from the associated wine bar next door. We found the duck egg, beef tongue, scallops, and charcuterie to be excellent and interesting. The oxtail stood out for being rather boring, and I've already forgotten some of our other choices. The place is quite meat-heavy, despite the lighter fare tapas implies. The table was also quite cramped and it was a juggling game to share plates. Despite enjoying it, we may find a place with a mix of light and heavy fare next time."
chavi,"Dined on January 19, 2013",3,The only sad thing about it is that if you arrive early there is no place to stay or wait. yo have to come back.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 18, 2013",2,"Very overrated. You can get much better quality tapas elsewhere, without the pretentiousness."
Lcedarpoint,"Dined on January 16, 2013",4,"ALWAYS a favorite for lunch for my hubby and I. Of all of Mario's places, still most unique flavors. Only critique this time, is that we came w our 3 kids, and we know its not kid place they were not even trying to accommodate. Just wont bring kids next time."
Manjusri,"Dined on January 15, 2013",3,"I'm disappointed to say that Casa Mono appeared to be resting on it's laurels when we visited last week. I have been dining there 2-3 times a year for as long as it has been open, and although the menu remains among the most creative, interesting, even exciting, the preparation and execution has drifted to mediocre. We found that some dishes were not prepared with care, and salt and other condiments were overused to the point of diminishing the natural flavor of the recipe. Service was at best barely satisfactory, which can be overlooked when the food special. Hopefully, Casa Mono will be able to return to it's tradition of exquisite preparation to go along with it's exceptional menu."
Steven,"Dined on January 14, 2013",5,Tapas/small plates really don't get any better.
francemichele,"Dined on January 13, 2013",3,"Fabulous tapas, especially the caramelized foie gras over shallots. a dream...."
LaSignora,"Dined on January 11, 2013",4,"Food and the wine recommended by our waitress was terrific. Unfortunately, the crowded tables and noise level really do detract from the quality of the experience. It is almost impossible not to be bumped into and a private conversation is simply impossible. I realize this is a hot spot, but these menu items and the corresponding prices deserve a more elegant experience!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 11, 2013",1,Terrible experience. Rude service. Loud 80's music. Food that's meant to be shared yet incredibly difficult to share. Unimpressive food.
Jessyjessyjessy,"Dined on January 10, 2013",5,"Outstanding! The only reason I did not give the service an ""Excellent"" review is that we were in a corner table and the waiter had a difficult time getting to us physically. However, everything was just wonderful, and I would definitely go back. I had to impress someone on this lunch date, and it was the perfect place for that."
mitch,"Dined on January 7, 2013",3,"Food was very tasty and the wine list is very good. However, food service was rushed and could have been more friendly. Would advise restaurant managers to modify service to allow for a more leisurely dining experience. At Manhattan prices, allowing for a dining experience and not a fast food chain is recommended."
villagegal,"Dined on January 6, 2013",3,"Our second time at Casa Mono and second time we were on time for our reservation but are table wasn't ready and there is literally NO place to wait inside. Not great for a cold winter evening. But if you don't mind being sent outside and around the corner to a crowded bar where hopefully you'll be called for your table, go for it!  We do love the food and once seated were happy to given complimentary wine as apology for the wait. And were comped for the chewy artichokes that were the only disappointment on a VERY tasty and interesting menu from which we shared 11 dishes including dessert. Loved the ""burnt custard"" that was the best creme brulee ever!"
Terrific,"Dined on January 6, 2013",5,Spectacular! We ordered 10 dishes and every one was terrific!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 5, 2013",2,"The service was very rude.  After spending a lot of money for very little food, the woman told us that we had to leave to make room for the next reservation. We weren't even there for 2 hours. It was holiday season and we had a 5.30 reservation, and we were the only table there. The waiters were not friendly at all."
Pattilewmannel,"Dined on January 4, 2013",3,I was disappointed that they asked me to wait outside in the subzero weather for 3 min to wait for my other person.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 1, 2013",2,"The wine list and wine bar/tapas next door were great but the food was disappointing. I found it to be neither authentic nor an interesting version of authentic, for example, the pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas were just bad - heavily breaded and an unpleasant pumpkin taste, and the patatas bravas tasted like potatoes with hot sauce poured on them. I did enjoy the skirt steak but nonetheless have no interest in returning to the restaurant."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 1, 2013",2,ridiculously small dining room with people sitting on top of each other at tiny tables with staff and others constantly bumping into you would not go back food was good but dont see what the fuss is all about
shutterbugnyc,"Dined on January 1, 2013",1,"This is probably one of the most over-rated restaurants I've been to in NYC. We ordered the pumpkin croquettes, skirt steak, oxtail, setas & a Muga Reserva. The pumpkin croquettes were bland and tasteless. The setas had way too much garlic and salt in it. We did enjoy the skirt steak and the wine, but that was all we enjoyed here. We also don't appreciate the host (who looks like Psy) smelling our wine by putting his nose up to the bottle opening before serving it to us. We would not recommend this place, nor would we return here for another meal."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 30, 2012",5,Great special occasion restaurant or a place to go before a movie. You will feel like you have taken a trip to Spain.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 29, 2012",3,Disappointing food in cramped space. Nothing was memorable and prices were hefty for such underwhelming food.
Gratefuldoc,"Dined on December 29, 2012",3,"underwhelmed. expect much more from a Mchellin starred restaurant. spacing is horrific even for New York. no room on the tables. wait staff was disinterested and aloof. wine steward was great. food was uneven and portions small for the price. would choose other tapas restaurants despite the ""rating"". Definitely not the gem we were expecting."
LaFleur,"Dined on December 28, 2012",4,"Hot, dark, noisy, and cramped wine bar, so not for everyone, but if you like sampling lots of different flavors including grilled seafood and whole animal cookery, then this is the place. Fun to sit at counter. Great Spanish wine selections. Never disappoints."
KipC,"Dined on December 27, 2012",5,"Excellent food and service. Went two nights in one week, both times spectacular."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2012",4,great food love the small plates excellent wine suggestion
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 24, 2012",4,"The first 2 dishes were on the salty side, but as soon as I let the waitress know, the rest of the dishes were good. The tastes were incredible nonetheless. Service was great. There were only 2 a waitress and a waiter working at the time I was there. It was very busy, but their attitudes were great. It's on the pricey side, but I would say the service and flavors were worth it."
chrism,"Dined on December 21, 2012",1,"Made 11 pm reservation. Felt unwelcome from the start. Waiter was rude because we were his last table. The manager asked us to leave so she could go home, this after ordering a 200 bottle of wine. Food wasn't great this time around. Would never go back, mainly due to staff!!! Such a shame since it was my favorite place prior to Thursday nights experience."
MMG553,"Dined on December 19, 2012",1,Too noisy. Overpriced for what you get. No ambience. Cramped in small tables and we were rushed to finish our meal so they could turn over the table.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 16, 2012",3,"Food was very good. Server went on break and didn't tell anyone so we were completely ignored for at least 45 min! Once alerted, the other staff tried to take care of us. Finally, the bartender came out and helped. Still, we expect much better from a restaurant of this reputation and cost."
TomP,"Dined on December 14, 2012",5,"Excellent. Better than a lot of the places we ate at in Spain. I would recommend this to everyone. If we go back to New York and Casa Mono is still there, we will go again."
Cynthia,"Dined on December 13, 2012",4,Birthday dinner with two girlfriends - service was spotty at the restaurant but the food was simply outstanding and memorable. Was fun to share the tapas with my friends that night. Be prepared to sit very closely to your neighbors in this tiny restaurant. Very fun- recommend highly and look forward to returning!
JamesF,"Dined on December 13, 2012",4,Outstanding tapas served in a tiny room. The staff navigates the space with amazing grace.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 9, 2012",5,Food was outstanding! The foie GRAS was pure decadence and a perfect blend of seasonings.
ErickN,"Dined on December 7, 2012",3,Enjoyed the variety of dishes. Very loud and cramped space.
Paulsito,"Dined on December 7, 2012",3,Food was Horrible. It was so salty that by the end of the night my tongue was swollen.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 5, 2012",4,Good spot
dabble,"Dined on December 4, 2012",4,Wonderful experience. Interesting menu; better than I experienced in Spain. It challenges your palate to try new foods and food combinations but behind the seeming in congruency of the menu was actually well intended flavor combinations.
SandraS,"Dined on December 3, 2012",5,Ended up going twice. Food is great!!! Feels like in Spain.
Rosie,"Dined on December 1, 2012",5,Amazing and delicious. Unique flavours and plates you can share but you won't want to!
buster,"Dined on November 26, 2012",5,"Amazing, AMAZING Food!!! excellent combinations with fabuolous technique. Great recommendations from the server. Absolute entertainment to sit at the bar and walk through the menu; and don't miss the olive oil ice cream!"
Vanessa,"Dined on November 22, 2012",4,"Really great food as usual. Service was not as great as my first experience. Felt a bit rushed with the bussers coming by and clearing plates before confirming if I was finished. Also showed up early for a reservation to try to get a seat at the bar only to be told that the ""first come first serve"" bar has a wait list. Seemed odd that there would be a waitlist if it was supposed to be first come first serve. The hostess was kind enough to put us on the list and called us within 30 mins to let us know that 2 seats had opened up. Didn't seem like the waitlist was very long and she could have handled the situation in a friendlier and more acommodating manner."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 19, 2012",2,"Foie gras dish was the standount, however my girlfriend's was served cold. Other dishes were only OK. We tried the goat cheese and pumpkin fritters, the sweetbreads and one of the salads. Interesting spot and the wine list is good with a number of smaller producing regions in Italy represented. Service was attentive. Maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen."
WaltF,"Dined on November 18, 2012",4,Here's the place for a palate-pleasing pick-me-up — where small plates let you try out new tastes or new treatments.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 11, 2012",5,"Our group was only 6... large for this tiny place. But from the moment we walked in, we felt enveloped by the adventure. Food was really excellent, with plenty to please both timid and the explorers. Our server was particularly adept at pairing wine with the many plates she arranged in courses. We spent more than three hours eating, sipping and laughing on a lazy Sunday, and all of us walked away satisfied and grateful for a friend's recommendation of Casa Mono."
MAAB,"Dined on November 10, 2012",4,"We took an out-of-town friend here for brunch recently; we live in the neighborhood. The food is served in small dishes, so it's great for sampling and sharing. We ordered about 3 dishes for each person, and it was more than enough. And we didn't leave feeling hungry or stuffed. The food and service were excellent. I'd definitely go back."
Taster,"Dined on November 9, 2012",4,Great variety of tapas all cooked with sound knowledge of the products. Really nice taste combinations.

JohnF,"Dined on October 23, 2012",4,Went on a Monday this time and while the food was still great it was not as solid as the first time we enjoyed this restaurant. A couple of items came out not quite as hot as they should have and the service could have been better.
DianneC,"Dined on October 22, 2012",5,"Terrific food for most part. 4 out of 5 tapas were excellent. 5th was good but a bit bland (mamilla clams with chorizo). The pork croquette and the piquillo peppers with oxtail were particularly tasty. Had a lower end wine that was quite satisfactory. Wait staff did nice job. Not the place to go to if desire any privacy, but we had a delightful time."
rina,"Dined on October 20, 2012",5,Excellent tapas selection.. Razor clam is the best!
YiaYia,"Dined on October 20, 2012",3,"Like other highly rated & ""reasonably priced"" (for NYC) restaurants, this felt like a factory. Food was good, interesting, but the staff seemed more interested in ensuring our table turned over than in serving us. VERY loud. Next time I want a fun evening out, I'll go someplace where they're not so full of themselves."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 18, 2012",1,It was the worst restaurant I visited in the five days I spent in NYC.All the food was way too salty and cooked poorly.My two friends thought it was less than mediocre as well.
Graham,"Dined on October 18, 2012",5,"My wife and I spent a few days in New York going to plays and site seeing. A friend had recommended Casa Mono and we would recommend it to anyone. It is all small plates and a lot of not quite common dishes. The tongue was wonderful. The wine list is an extensive list of Spanish wines, also not that common, but very good quality. The bread pudding was delightful."
Quietbelow,"Dined on October 16, 2012",4,"I have been to Casa Mono twice now and absolutely love it.  For entirely reasonable prices you get wonderful food in a great cozy, laid-back and cheerful atmosphere.  The razor clams are a revelation, but the sepia, foie, and mussels with chorizo are all fantastic as well.  Though Casa Mono is great for foodies, not all the dishes are ambitious--but you don't need that from this neighborhood spot.  It's mostly about getting well-prepared, larger-than-average tapas-style dishes and sharing.  I would say four dishes take care of two people (many of them come with sauces you'll want to sop up with bread).    Surprisingly, the wine recommendations are more on point than higher-priced places.  Love Casa Mono."
AKDL,"Dined on October 16, 2012",4,"My husband and I LOVED Casa Mono. This is a small, tightly packed restaurant with fantastic tapas-style dishes. We had the mussels (wonderful), the Iberico ham (the real deal - expertly hand sliced), chorizo and garbanzos, and the much talked about Pork Belly. All were delicious. The place was packed (I recommend a reservation) and service is a bit slow - but everything is made as it is ordered, so when they are busy it is entirely understandable and worth the wait. We'll be back!"
JamieI,"Dined on October 12, 2012",5,Incredible. Just so sweet and perfect all around.
MV2017,"Dined on October 11, 2012",4,"Too noisy; otherwise, awesome; the food is great."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 10, 2012",4,"Great food! Friendly wait staff, although the sommelier seems to be lacking in knowledge and has an unwelcoming attitude."
KarenD,"Dined on October 9, 2012",3,"The food is interesting, well prepared variations on classic tapas. The wine list is long and too heavily weighted to the upper end. We would have been lost without the help of the wonderful sommelier. The noise level will keep me from returning"
Vijay168,"Dined on October 7, 2012",3,"Second time around was not as satisfying as the first time. Fish was under salted; scallops were fantastic except for the sauce/small bits of cantoloupe did not work; pine nuts were good though. Lamb duo had a very good chop but the sausage was OK, a bit dry and salty; vegetable ragu good but not memorable. The tendency for the staff to ask for reservations when the restaurant is half empty (and remain empty for the next one hour) is too snooty."
ychungelle,"Dined on October 5, 2012",4,"Tapas menu was different from other restaurants, very original and tasty. Extensive wine list. Small place but with a lot of vibrant energy (and noise). I enjoyed all of my dishes, and overall was a great experience!"
mian,"Dined on October 4, 2012",3,"I had not been to Casa Mono in years and decided to take my husband there for his birthday. The good food and wine was ruined by the server's efforts to rush us. No, we couldn't order tapas as we ate because the chef preferred the full order at one time, we were told. After we declined dessert but said we wanted another round of wine, we were told to go next door to the restaurant's bar to free up the table. I had heard such stories about restaurants in NY when I first moved to the city in the 1980s but had never experienced the humiliation. We eat out at least twice a week and I can't remember ever being rushed out like that. Needless to say, we won't be going back."
Wonderfulwino,"Dined on October 2, 2012",3,"CM has became a bit haughty with the Michelin star. Food is down to earth but not overwhelming. The wine list is fantastic, one of the best as far as Spanish wines are concerned. Overall a decent experience but for a hafty price..."
Hotelie81,"Dined on September 30, 2012",4,"The food and the service were both unique and truly wonderful! Our server helped us pick an outstanding wine to compliment the food. As an operator of several fine dining restaurants in the Finger Lakes region of the state, I appreciate great food and service and this restaurant delivers both!"
Anne,"Dined on September 29, 2012",4,"Interesting and unusual Spanish food, small plates, beautiful stemware to match incredible wine list. We sat at the bar, Fernando was attentive and friendly.  Our greeter at the door could have been more welcoming. We arrived early, there were only a few tables filled, restaurant was mostly empty. Maitre'd was brusque and took a phone call before seating us. He needs a lesson in warm welcomes when couples are about to drop $200-$250 for a meal in a tiny, noisy restaurant.  That being said, the meal was wonderful, and our bartender/waiter was outstanding."
Kerr,"Dined on September 26, 2012",4,Wait staff happy to make recommendations that are generally spot on. Busy and loud but in a good way. Kitchen has great pacing and all wait staff are super attentive.
JulieK,"Dined on September 23, 2012",5,Space is a little tight so recommended for groups of 4 or less.
ThomasS,"Dined on September 22, 2012",3,"Quality was great, quantity was dissapointing. I understand that we ordered tapas and not entres, but could be a little more generous with the portions - perhaps 20% more food per dish? Tasty. Service was good. Restaurant was romantic and relaxing - we ate late afternoon before the rush and place wasn't full so it was kind of nice and quiet. Overall, good but didn't leave feeling I had to tell someone that they had to go to this place. Been to many Batali/Bastianich restaurants and generally enjoy. Thanks for listening."

Jennywar,"Dined on September 21, 2012",5,"We ate here 5 years ago and thought it was a knock out then! Even better 5 years later. Incredibly delicious and inventive food.... Baby artichokes grilled and dressed with mint, lemon and oil. Shave grilled octopus and shaved grilled fennel... an extraordinary texture sensation.Fabulous.It epitomizes quintessential New York neighbourhood dining and is so tiny with tables just elbow size in width and water glass in a small shelf under the table. Excellent attentive service. Great experience. Not cheap but worth it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 21, 2012",5,"Loved the food and the staff was great with answering our questions! They also helped us to order the right amount of food since it was tapas. Small and quaint, wouldn't go with a large group of people. Can't wait to go back!"
CCNYC,"Dined on September 14, 2012",3,"Wow, two people, 7 plates, three small pitchers of very good wine, not priceless exactly, but outstanding nevertheless!"
Madison,"Dined on September 12, 2012",4,We just love this restaurant. Cannot get enough of the wonderful delicious food. We also enjoy the next door wine bar. We usually get there ahead of our reservation to have a glass of wine and a plate of cheese with ham at the bar.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 9, 2012",5,Great little spot that you would probably pass over if you were just walking down the street.  Sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare the tapas.  You will end up ordering everything though because it all looks so good!  Anything with seafood is a must!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 7, 2012",5,"Our experience was amazing, great food, fresh and very chic... We had a table of 6 and everything was just great. Would definitely go back... The wine list is beyond amazing !!!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2012",5,We enjoyed our second visit to Casa Mono and would definitely recommend it! Great food and the bar right beside it was also a great place to wait until our table was available. Many wines to choose from. We had a table right beside the open windows. Busy little place so some great people watching as well. Cheers!
MartinG,"Dined on September 3, 2012",2,"Don't bother going unless you're a friend of the waitstaff. Items which were ""no longer available"" for the night mysteriously appeared at a neighboring table that was seated and ordered after we did. There are too many tables in too small a space and the food just isn't good enough to justify the experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 31, 2012",4,"Dining at Casa Mono is an energetic, flavorful and exciting experience.  The service -- from the Maitre D's first greeting to the last farewell of our knowledgeable waiter -- was outstanding. The latter recommended excellent, affordable, unpretentious wine that paired perfectly with our dishes. He coursed the meal very well, giving us time to savor such items as perfectly cooked scallops and indulgent sweetbreads before heading on to sublime desserts. Even when a nasty, jaded and generally despicable group of adults next to us argued with him over a trivial check error, our waiter did not compromise our eating experience.  All things considered, the meal was excellent. However, I would have enjoyed a more generous serving of Iberico h"
RichardM,"Dined on August 31, 2012",5,"Absolutely excellent. A very different restaurant with great food, an interesting environment, and excellent service. It is very small so one cannot object to the hustle and bustle but that is part of the experience...."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 30, 2012",5,Casa Mono is centrally located in the Union Square area. The food is superb and this is a great option if you want to be adventurous and try new things. I'm a big fan of small plates so that I can try many different foods and I was not disappointed.
Customer,"Dined on August 29, 2012",2,the food was very heavy but it's batali type intense floors the wine was expensive and selections by the glass were. limited. the wine list is marked up way to much paid 25 bucks for a quoting ( two small servings)of a mediocre Spanish wine batali must do better than that
tommy,"Dined on August 27, 2012",4,"Very loud, tables so close you can smell your neighbors, really interesting wines, great service, stellar tapas, try the goat it rocks"
RussW,"Dined on August 25, 2012",5,The food was terrific. Everything was well propepared and well balanced. I can't recommend the Charcuterie enough. On the othe best I have ever had.

KarineB,"Dined on August 12, 2012",4,"Everytime I go to NYC I have to stop at Casa Mono, I usually like to write and tell what I had, but it has been a while and I don't remember. The only dish I do rememeber is the Clam with the little pasta. This is delicious. Everything is cook perfectly. I will be back again when I'll be in NYC. a place not to miss."
Bestofbest,"Dined on August 12, 2012",5,have eaten here over a dozen times and am more impressed each time. one of my top in nyc
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 12, 2012",1,"I am a NY'er, and this was one of the worst dining experiences ever in NYC! The dinner started well with good appetizers and a somelier who knew his wines, but after that it was a train wreck. All of the pasta dishes we ordered were overcooked and had little to no flavor whatsoever. The worst of the worst was the ravioli dish which looked like it had come from a Chef Boyarde can and just dumped on the plate. Otto is supposed to be a 'hot spot' for dining, but it was simply a 'hot mess!' The owners really need to check in with the chef to improve the main dishes. This was such a disappointment since I know the owners must know better than to serve something like this!"
dave50,"Dined on August 11, 2012",3,"Casa Mono was good, but failed to meet expectations. Some of the combinations in the tapas were overly ambitious, and didn't work well. While different and new combinations and flavors can be fun and enjoyable, sometimes you stretch to far, when its not needed. Otherwise, the quality and preparation was excellent, and the service was helpful and cheerful."
NewYork1,"Dined on August 7, 2012",2,Very expensive and the food was barely okay. The waiter asked if he could take our order twice after we were seated for no more than a few minutes. Also he brought the check even though we didn't ask for it immediately after we were finished with our meal and indicated we did not want dessert.
ShankarM,"Dined on August 3, 2012",5,"Food quality is simply amazing. A bit on the expensive side, but well worth it."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 2, 2012",4,The waiter was very helpful with his opinions about th menu. The pork belly was excellent. Could have skipped the calamares.
tpujol,"Dined on August 1, 2012",3,"The area is really small and can be a little loud. Not a good place for first dates. The wine list was magnificent. I found a basque white that was fantastic, but only one item from the Balearic Islands. The food was very authentic, the squid is the star of the menu and the pan con tomate tastes like Spain."
IRAS,"Dined on August 1, 2012",4,Nice
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 26, 2012",4,"The food here (except the bone marrow, which I found to be very bland) is worth many visits (and the high price tag, and the sub-par service).  Highly recommend the bacalao croquetas!!"
StephanieM,"Dined on July 23, 2012",4,"Amazing fois gras - the best I've ever had!! Fresh, innovative menu.. I highly recommend this place to foodies. If you love food and love to try new things, new flavors you will love Casa Mono. You cannot be afraid to try anchovies for example, as I guarantee you have never had anchovies like that. They were fresh and tender, served on delicious crusty toasted bread with this wonderful olive overtop -magnificent  One thing I did not enjoy was the pork charcuterie plate - Too fatty. Oh yeah and the tables have a compartment underneith in which they keep the water glasses, making it impossible for a woman to cross her legs. It wasn't the end of the world though ;)  Can't wait to go back."
looking4gems,"Dined on July 22, 2012",3,"The food was delicious, even though a little salty. We ordered dishes on the richer side and were satisfied with only 2 per person. The dishes were quite pricey, however, and their size and quality did not merit the price tag. Additionally, the service was disappointing. Our empty water glasses were never proactively refilled (we had to flag down our waitress four seperate times when our glasses were empty), our waitress's demeanor was generally curt, and we were seated more than half an hour after our reservation time (which was late in the evening and we were starving). Our group consensus was that we would return but only if someone else was picking up the tab."
MalcolmH,"Dined on July 21, 2012",5,"Casa Mono's high-end tapas is, without doubt, the best tapas I have had in my life. It is well worth the somewhat-high per-plate cost. The wine list is impressive; and even the least-expensive Rioja ($60) which I ordered was spectacular."
JohnP,"Dined on July 21, 2012",5,"There's a reason We go back to Casa Mono every time we're in NYC. The food and the experience keeps getting better. It was our 10th wedding anniversary and once again, Casa Mono surpassed our expectations. We'll be back soon."
tlala,"Dined on July 20, 2012",5,Always wonderful and a must when visiting NY
Dave,"Dined on July 18, 2012",4,"Exceptional food. Service was professional this time, albeit a touch cold. Wine list is all Spanish, with an emphasis on expensive bottles. Can't miss dishes: duck egg with black truffle and fingerling potato; pork belly with plantain; clams with chorizo; baby squid. Can't miss."
JIMA,"Dined on July 18, 2012",5,"We were recommended CasaMono by my son George who frequented the rest when he was in new York The food was exceptional , full praise and congratulations to chef and mangement. Could not be faulted and the service was excellent Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and would most definitely come back and also recommend to any one. 10 out of 10 Jim Anassis Melbourne Australia"
scottykeats,"Dined on July 15, 2012",2,"I've been to Casa Mono many times. I've benn here twice in the last 4 months and both times the food has been very disappointing. Salty weel done soft shell crabs, two tiny salty scallops for $17.00 and crispy calamari with a farm egg that came burnt and the egg hardboiled. We also noticed the people next to us returning their Paella. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants in NYC."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 14, 2012",5,"Loved every little plate - from the sepia to the rabbit. Fun to sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare the food. Only slight negative was the dishes were a bit heavy-handed at times with the salt. Other than that, the meal was great, the staff friendly and welcoming, and the wine list interesting."
Apple,"Dined on July 14, 2012",4,Cramped quarters...waitors and hostess were a bit aloof but their razor clam appetizer made it all worthwhile...
Jann,"Dined on July 13, 2012",4,"We shared 4 Tapas; Garlic Razor Clames-very tasty-a few were overcooked and very chewy, Beets with goat cheese were very good but overpriced at $14. Baby Octopus were delicious. Patatas Bravas were a surprise as these are traditionally fried potatoes. Casa Mono version were very good, not fried and in a sauce. It was very busy and noisy."
GraceH,"Dined on July 10, 2012",2,"Overpriced, overhyped tapas...just because it's Batali, doesn't make it good"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 7, 2012",4,"Excellent seafood. Razor clams were beautifully cooked. Softshell crabs were fresh. Duck and mole were a little salty but the cucumbers rescued it. Made ""boring"" salmon interesting."
KimC,"Dined on July 7, 2012",5,"Great food and service, very seasonal menu. Recommended for a nice night out."
Paul,"Dined on July 5, 2012",5,Best Tapas in NYC! Worthy of a much larger dining room. Space is a problem.
Vanessa,"Dined on July 2, 2012",5,Everything from the food to the service to the atmosphere was spot on. The kitchen was super accommodating for a friend that had several food allergies. They went the extra mile to ensure that he experience wa as great as the rest of us. The server also made an excellent wine recommendation based on the food we ordered and our budget. I would go back in a heart beat.  Must order: - foie gras - cod cheeks - stuffed calamares
lpete,"Dined on July 2, 2012",4,"Casa Mono is tiny and was already full by the time we arived for our 6 PM reservation. Loved the mosaic floor. I wish we didn't have to place our entire order at once...we ended up over ordering. (As with any tapas place, the recommendation is 2-3 dishes/person. We went with 6 which was about 1 too many for us.) We tried mussels with chorizo; roasted beet salad; pork belly; patatas bravas and scallops with carrots. The most memorable plates were the scallops and carrots and the mussels with chorizo. I would have both again. I found the pork belly less successful. It was served with plantains but seemed heavy and uninspired after the other fresher, summery dishes. Huge wine list with some reasonably priced options."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 2, 2012",3,"some good some not so good dishes.....too much meat, fish, etc. not enough other options. Stay away from the charcuterie unless you enjoy headcheese. wine was quite nice, good selection."
Shelly,"Dined on June 30, 2012",1,"the food and service were good; however, the whole experience was ruined as the a/c was out and it was so hot I thought we were being punished for something. It was a shame that we got no reduction in cost for this painful experience. (the ambient temp was around 98 degrees)"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 30, 2012",3,unfortunately air conditioing was broen and a bit difficult without to enjoy what casa mono has to offer
choosey,"Dined on June 28, 2012",4,creativity and quality of the food was excellent.
JoyB,"Dined on June 25, 2012",4,Casa Mono always has great tapas and fresh tasting food. The recipes are definitely different than any other tapas restaurant in NYC. The wine selection is also big.
Connie,"Dined on June 25, 2012",4,Very flavorful food however a bit heavy on the salt. Tiny restaurant so need to get a nice table by the windows or you'll be uncomfortable!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 22, 2012",2,"Visited Casa Mono 2 years ago was superb, food and service on the spot. Service was horrible, lack of training on pouring cava, dripping all over, she was not happy with her job, never encounter a server like this before in my life, i was suprise to be in a 1 star michelin establishment restaurant. I've been to all star michelin restuarnt in NYC and also in International arena, i am going to send a feedback to the board in france since my husband is french and in the industry regarding to this restaruant rating. i hope the management team will terminate her, she doesn't belong there and i would not return unless she is gone,i've been to restaruant for total of 8 times. I rarely being vocal or take my time to write a comment."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 20, 2012",2,The food was very average and the portions small. The prices were outragous considering the small plates (portions) required ordering multiple dishes. It certainly was not worth the $100/ person cost. Nothing was particularily good and I would not go back.
Oziad,"Dined on June 19, 2012",1,It might have been succeeded on creating as a tapas bar in Spain. But food hasn't.
JadwigaW,"Dined on June 18, 2012",2,"We went to Casa Mono on a Sunday evening, with a friend who was visiting from the UK. The food was too salty and very pricey for the portion sizes and the restaurant was very cramped. Overall, nothing to write home about - we won't be going back."
nickyd0314,"Dined on June 17, 2012",5,"This was our second visit to Casa Mono and I have to say this just might be my favorite restaurant in NYC. We love the tapas style so we get to try a variety of dishes and Casa Mono does not disappoint. The dishes are all so good its hard to have a favorite. The softshell crab, polpo and seppia are among the top, but also the rabbit and the foie gras were excellent. Love the atmosphere and our server was outstanding. Her recommendations for wines were excellent since my knowledge of Spanish wines is a little weak. All in all our favorite lille place to go."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 15, 2012",2,"Mario Batali's staff should take a lesson or two fom Danny Meyer in how to provide good customer service. Yes, the food is always good, but since the restaurant has opened, the staff has been consistently arrogant. From the host to the wait staff, rarely do you get friendly service, let alone a smile. In fact we were chastised by our waitress during a recent business lunch. We wanted to add a dish after ordering and were told quite bluntly that we couldn't do that...we had to have ordered all at once. Really? I've gone repeatedly, often at the insistance of others who are wowed by the name, but as a Gramercy Park denizen, there are plenty of other fabulous restaurants where I can get good food, and be treated well."
Olivier,"Dined on June 13, 2012",2,The food was good but not memorable. The highlight for me as odd as this sounds was the olive oil ice cream. Service was very poor. Not a smile or kind word whatsoever and we had to stand up from our table and walk over to the bar to order a glass of wine. Too many restaurants in NYC to consider returning.
David,"Dined on June 8, 2012",4,"Excellent small plates. Would have given five stars, but the dessert left a little to be desired. I recommend the rabbit and the quail."

CraigR,"Dined on June 4, 2012",4,If this is your first visit you should ask about the items on the menu. Some of them are different from what you assume. That being said many of the items are wonderfully unique.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 2, 2012",4,Excellent food. Old favorites done with a new twist. Each bite was a pleasure and I found myself trying to figure out what the secret ingredient in each dish consisted of. Excellent wine recommendation also.
CatherineS,"Dined on May 31, 2012",3,"Nothing spoils a great meal quicker than preposterous condescending service. Hopefully, it was just our waiter, or should I say Service Person, or whatever he would like to be called, but I know for certain he didn't like waiting on 3 women."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 28, 2012",4,"Food was delicious, our seating was a little cramped, the restaurant is very small and therefore seating is at a prime and the 3 2-tops in the corner are VERY tight!  But once you squeezed into your table and were patient as servers and the other tables squeezed and bumped into you as they maneuvered around the tables you realized it was all worth it because the food was delicious.  We had the pork belly, ox tail, lamb, meat/cheese plate and octopus - ALL were very delicious! Would definitely go again, just request a table in the main dining area or outside."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 27, 2012",5,"My wife and I got a day away from the kids so we spent it in NYC. My wife wanted to try a Mario Batali restaurant and we decided on Casa Mono. What a great choice! We were planning on either a show or comedy club later on so we had an early dinner (4:30pm). We decided on six plates to share: razor clams, lobster salad, soft shell carb, foie gras, beet/bacon salad, and the pork belly. Every dish had great presentation and fantastic flavor. My personal favorite was by far the foie gras followed by the razor clams. We also tried three of their bolder reds by the glass and were not disappointed with these either. Dessert put us over the top...my wife had the chocolate granache with olive oil ice cream and I had the bread pudding,great!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 23, 2012",4,The food was great but a bit overpriced for what you get (they're tapas)....heard the service wasn't great and have to agree- waiter was a bit snobbish.
Steffi,"Dined on May 22, 2012",4,"Delicious food, but on the salty side... Lovely restaurant in a lovely neighborhood."
Sp00nful56,"Dined on May 21, 2012",4,"We loved the oxtail stuffed in piquillo peppers, the casa mono salad & fideos with clams. however, the dorada in tomato ancho sauce fell short of expectations. the sauce reminded me of the kind you get with canned sardines. olives were fantastic as was the bread. choc ganache & olive oil ice cream amazing! our waiter needed to smile. overall, a great experience. We were there for lunch, so I can't accurately comment on noise level. Quiet when we were there."
SteveS,"Dined on May 20, 2012",5,Best Spanish wine list anywhere.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 19, 2012",2,"I was really looking forward to dining at Casa Mono, but was instead left very disappointed. The maître d' and waitstaff were totally cold. I don't know if that was the point, but they succeeded at being distant and inhospitable. We were seated in an out of the way table and were left without water or a menu for sometime. Our waiter never came to check on us or take our order, we had to always ask someone to send him over or stare down the maître d' to get his attention. And I was totally put off when, after ordering a bread appetizer to start, he asked if that was all we were having... as if we came by only to drink water and eat bread. $100+ and tip later, that might not have been a bad idea."
Seagal,"Dined on May 19, 2012",5,"Casa Mono was our choice for a post-Broadway dinner and it did not disappoint. We called ahead to say we would be adding one person to the reservation for two and the hostess said that would be fine. This cozy, candle-lit ""boite"" has about a dozen tables, so it was great that they made it work for us. The waiter was very helpful with Spanish wine selections and we loved the fresh Casa Mono salad and the sizzling pan of delicious paella for three which was a perfect late-night meal. Open-air walls of windows to the street were a lovely feature for the mild spring evening and it was a quick taxi ride down from Times Square. If you enjoy small, intimate restaurants with outstanding, authentic Spanish tapas then don't hesitate to visit."
Indigo,"Dined on May 17, 2012",4,"We were lucky to have seats by the open kitchen bar. The food was great and our dining experience was definitely enhanced by watching the chefs prepare our food. While our waiter was so-so, we were absolutely impressed by the restaurant management's responsiveness. When I commented that one dish was not quite as tasty as the rest, she promptly remove the charge for that dish from our bill."

fredsfaves,"Dined on May 14, 2012",5,"Really outstanding experience. Great food, creative dishes well prepared, attentive service, good vibe. Two qualifiers: some tables sit too close to each other and the wine list is a bit pricey, with not enough moderately priced options."

RobinM,"Dined on May 3, 2012",4,"As long as you are prepared for the extremely cramped space, and don't need to speak to anyone because of the noise, Casa Mono serves excellent tapas. Try the rabbit!"
MahiliaJ,"Dined on May 2, 2012",4,"The wine was wonderful, location ideal and dinning company was perfect It would have received a higher rating if not for the server. He completely ignored me except to take my dinner order - had my friend sample the wine (even though it was my birthday dinner), and not very welcoming. A great place to grab a glass of wine but there are many option in NYC."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 22, 2012",3,tables are very close together so don't go if you want to have a business dinner or a very private one. Tables are small and uncomfortable for tall people. But they were very nice and even gave us a drink on the house for our anniversary. We will go back...
Alex,"Dined on April 17, 2012",5,"from thorough and thoughful service, an incredible wine menu, and expertly crafted tapas that reminded us of spain, all the way to the open doors with a perfect spring breeze and fresh air, we enjoyed every moment in my group of friends visiting from out of town."
Bobby,"Dined on April 14, 2012",5,"Staff was very helpful even though we were late(called at intermission of the musical to tell them we would be). We loved the place. It was just what we wanted, tapas, great wine and good music."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 7, 2012",2,"Way overpriced for the atmosphere (crowded) and the amount of food you get (very little). I know it's tapas, but maybe bring down your prices just a little?? Not worth it."
PeterC,"Dined on April 7, 2012",3,"We'd always sat at the counter and enjoyed watching the chefs and eating our meal. This time we had to sit at the table we'd reserved, as all the counter space was taken (now I know why!....they don't take reservations for the counter). The tables are cramped; I worried about knocking over the glassware. The room is too dark; my husband couldn't read the menu and 'show us the bottle' of wine?....who could see it! I guess there's more lighting at the counter, so the chefs can see what they're cooking. Someone came over to ask if we wanted help with a wine selection and when we asked for 'a minute', disappeared for at least 10. Service was take the order and that's it. The food, however, is delicious with an extensive wine menu."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 1, 2012",4,Definitely need a make a reservation. This place is great for groups too (can order many tapas for sharing) as well as getting wine bottles.
ewindels,"Dined on March 30, 2012",3,"With the vast financial resources at their disposal, I'm a little surprised that the proprietors of this joint have opted to remain in the original miniscule, cramped, uncomfortable, painfully loud space. Plus the price ratio struck me as high: $90 (with tip) for the tiny portions we had left me dubious. Crossing this one off my list."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 26, 2012",4,"I first became interested in Casa Mono after having an amazing mid afternoon munch at Bar Jamon and wanting more. After actually going to Casa Mono, I can't say that I didn't enjoy my time, but I left wishing there was just a little something more to it. The food was good - some dishes were a little over seasoned for my liking (a bit too much salt), and the sweetbreads were slightly overpowered by the almonds. The Iberico Jamon was as delicious as it should be, and hand carved adds a nice difference in texture to the outstanding quality of the meat. Furthermore, the sommelier delivered an absolute amazing bottle of wine, exactly what I was craving, mild bodied Spanish red with just enough mineral bite. Good experience overall."
BarbaraM,"Dined on March 23, 2012",5,This is a great place. We had a late lunch starting at 3 PM and it was a beautiful day with the side windows open to the outside. Our waiter was superb and each and every dish was spectacular. I picked this place because they serve sweetbreads and I was not disappointed. This is a small restaurant so going for a late lunch gave us time to enjoy the whole experience. Barbara
bob46,"Dined on March 19, 2012",5,"This restaurant can be hard to get into at night, but you can enjoy the same wonderful menu choices at lunch, when it's also quieter. The portion sizes are small, so you can sample a variety of dishes, especially if you and your companions share. This is not an inexpensive lunch spot, but the food, ambiance, service, and Irving Place location make it well-worth the money."
corvax,"Dined on March 19, 2012",5,"A turly remarkable place. Every time i go on open table i always check to see if casa mono is available, unfortunately its not all the time but tonight it was and i will savour the fideos till the next visit."
EdwinT,"Dined on March 18, 2012",2,The food is highly overrated- many of the flavor combinations are complete misses. The portions are larger than tapas but smaller than appetizers. The seats are very uncomfortable- imagine trying to have a meal at your grade school desk with your knees constantly hitting your water glass. The service was fair- plates piled up on the tiny table.

nycubanpete,"Dined on March 13, 2012",5,An absolute delight in Gramercy Park....you do feel like you're in neighborhood tapas bar outside of Madrid...the food is just exquisite.....
susaningramercy,"Dined on March 13, 2012",2,"So so We live in the area and have been to this restaurant many times since it opened. It has gone from good to very ordinary. Tired food, lack luster wait staff, too noisy for words. I try desperately not to go back, but often friends want to go because it is near our house. Would not recommend."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 11, 2012",5,Our favorite casual dining restaurant in the country. Food is amazing.
deecath,"Dined on March 11, 2012",5,Always love Casa Mono. We sampled some new additions to the menu per our server's recommendations. Particularly loved the cod cheeks! Server was very knowledgeable and attentive though not overly friendly. Everything was excellent as usual.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 10, 2012",4,The food was excellent even though the plate sizes were small.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 2, 2012",5,EXCELLENT FOOD AND WINES. GOOD SERVICE OVERALL
dovi6160,"Dined on February 28, 2012",2,Over priced. Service was poor and food just OK The restaurant is very small so tables and chairs are close to one another.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 27, 2012",4,"We dined as a couple for lunch. The restaurant was about half full, but the atmosphere was still excellent - feels very authentically Spanish. The wine list is very Spanish, and the selection excellent! The food here is the real star though. We ate razor clams (amazing!), the spanish salad, and bacalao croquetas to start with. The croquetas were good, but a little heavy. The clams were memorable. We then shared the pork stuffed squid (highly recommended), boned quail with tomato raisins, and the duck egg with mojama. All were really good, and I would order them again. Overall this a destination for those wanting to eat very well (and, to bring back fond memories of Barcelona holidays!)."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 27, 2012",5,"Exceptional food, perfect service, not a weak link in the food chain whatsoever. Courteous, attentive and aware. I have nothing but good things to report."
IgnacioM,"Dined on February 26, 2012",5,"One of the best price/value restaurants in NYC. Its main atribute is certainly the quality of the food, absolutely amazing spanish food. Great for a moment when you wish to have a very good meal in a relatively informal setting. Pork croquetas are amazing."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 22, 2012",4,"We ordered 5 dishes to share between the 2 of us. Each dish was unique in taste, flavor, ingredients and cooking method. All dishes were incredibly tasty, with the crispy pork belly, skirt steak and salad being stand outs and memorable. The lamb in Moroccan spices was a tad too sweet and salty."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 20, 2012",3,"My boyfriend and I were in the city Sunday night and decided to check out Casa Mono. The restaurant itself was really nice,great tables and space, small and love the open kitchen concept. The food though was just not as great as we had anticipated. Definitely felt a bit let down. We had several different plates and shared. Meat was tough and seafood seemed a bit overdone. Best part of the meal was our dessert and I'm not much of a dessert person. I most likely would not return as there really was nothing that stood out food wise for us."
Elemich,"Dined on February 17, 2012",5,It's not always easy to get into Casa Mono--it's pretty jammed at night--but it's always worth it. The food is really outstanding--great unusual tapas like sweetbreads and bone marrow. Portions can be larger than the usual small Spanish tapas so order accordingly. The best time to get in is a late lunch.
RunsInHeels,"Dined on February 15, 2012",5,One of my favorite spots in NYC. The pumpkin-goat cheese croquettes are heavenly.
Miguel,"Dined on January 29, 2012",4,Outstanding food. Almost can't miss on any of the dishes. The service was good enough but the food is definitely what you come here for.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 27, 2012",5,"Delicious! It was the perfect choice for my boyfriends 30th birthday.  A nice dinner for two + exciting and delicious food + great wine = overall a very positive experience!  It is definitely a cozy space, so keep in mind if you don't like cozy spaces-though if you don't you are missing out on a lot of great places to eat in NYC!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 23, 2012",3,Good was great and delicious just like the previous time (2008)! Our waiter seemed uninterested in serving us but was adequate and polite. The ambience was a little odd for daytime service with the low lighting and experimental-rock music playing in the background. Didn't feel like it went with the culture of the food.
Summer17,"Dined on January 21, 2012",3,Food was great and pretty place with large wine selection however too small place and tables are jammed and it was really loud. I can hear everything from next tables.
Charly,"Dined on January 19, 2012",5,I could go back here again and again.
LyndaH,"Dined on January 15, 2012",5,The tapas were outstanding! The pumpkin goatcheese and the cod croquetas were fabulous. Everything that we had on the menu was memorable.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 14, 2012",5,AMAZING!!! a must visit.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 10, 2012",5,"Fantastic food. We've been going to Casa Mono for about 4 years now, and the food has never missed. Service is generally pretty attentive and friendly. I recommend the signature salad, skirt steak, and crispy pork belly. Caveats: It's a small space with small tables. Not a lot of elbow room. And the kitchen is open, so in some rare instances your clothes may smell a little."
dfny,"Dined on January 8, 2012",5,Delicious! Can't wait to go back!
Lesdum,"Dined on January 7, 2012",5,My favorite restaurant in NYC. Perfection!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 5, 2012",4,Food was great. Mojama with duck egg and black tufles was outstanding It was loud but we were there late so that was expected.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 4, 2012",1,"We were really disappointed by our first encounter with Batali's cousine at Casa Mono. We were prepared for the Spartan ambience of the place. What we did not really expect was the coldness of the service and the low quality of the food. Apart from mussels, which were barely decent, the pork croquette, the staffed calamari and the charcuterie were below average standards. In order to escape an extreme taste of garlic which pervaded all dishes, we tried the chocolate ganache with olive oil and salt. Again, we met a very pretentious interpretation of a banal dessert. What a shame for an ""iron chef"", he really could do better by staying simpler!"
alan,"Dined on December 31, 2011",3,"overall food is pretty good, but maybe with less choices on a menu it could be better. Everything was very salty"
LaFleur,"Dined on December 30, 2011",5,We love Casa Mono. We sit at the bar and watch them prepare all the amazing dishes. Each plate is rich and vibrant. The vibe of the entire restaurant is warm and inviting. I like to focus on the whole animal part of the menu. My wife loves the seafood dishes. The spanish wines are unique and delicious.
RodWat,"Dined on December 29, 2011",5,"This is a first class authentic Spanish experience. If you want to experience a great Spanish meal (or simply tapas and a drink at the bar) this is the place. Small, exciting atmosphere, genuine Spanish staff, and food to die for. Don't miss it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 23, 2011",2,"I met two long-time dear friends for dinner here to celebrate holidays and we all 3 agreed that the people/servers were quite rude. We did call to say one of us was running late (approx 10 mins)- understandably this impacts a small restaurant- and when I arrived, I was told me my friend was next door and I should go get her and sit now and then told us at least 5x that we had to be out by 7:30(it was only 5:45 when we sat). They rushed us and were rude with order taking and delivery of food. They acted like they were doing us some favor by serving us. The food was very good and it is a warm interior-(although tight). None of us will return here as there was nothing that made us feel like we'd want to- lots of good food in NYC elsewhere.."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 23, 2011",4,"Most of the food was excellent. In particular - beets with blue cheese and bacon, pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas, razor clams (EXCELLENT!!), pulpo with fennel and grapfruit, oxtail stuffed peppers, skirt steak with onion mermelada. Not as good was the crispy pork belly, and the jamon iberico (for the price). We were a party of 4, and it was too cramped to serve more than 3-4 plates at a time. The tables are too small for the tapas type menu. Also - very loud. Anything more than a party of 4, and you would not be able to talk to all at your table. Overall - highly recommend."
SydneyFriends,"Dined on December 22, 2011",4,Interesting menu with tapas style dishes - fusion Spanish-American modern. Very well trained and attentive staff in a small restaurant space
JayneelP,"Dined on December 21, 2011",5,"I took my girlfriend there for her birthday. We both are such foodies. We had the opportunity to try new things. The service, ambiance, and food were excellent."
wally,"Dined on December 18, 2011",5,"Amazing Spanish food , creative and full of both subtle and robust flavor. Such a treat!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 15, 2011",3,"The food is extraordinary here. We didn't, however, appreciate the waiter trying to pressure us to order more than we wanted. When we put in our order he stated ""I can't let you order just three dishes. The kitchen is busy so you must put in your complete order now."" When we insisted that was our complete order, he kept pushing and warning us that we couldn't add food later, which seems antithetical to the ethos of tapas. We stuck to our guns and were perfectly full after ""just"" three dishes (plates may be small, but they're piled high and quite rich, so very filling)."
Gormay13,"Dined on December 10, 2011",5,Wonderful place to sit and graze at the bar. Food can come out a little too fast when it's not even so busy but other than that this place is wonderful for special small plates that are simple yet refined. YUM!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 10, 2011",4,"The food was delicious! The menu was full of bold moves, and the culinary technique was definitely impressive. The food is a little on the pricey side and the restaurant space is a little on the small side, but it was an enjoyable experience nonetheless. Oh, and they also have an excellent sommelier."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 8, 2011",5,My favorite restaurant of all time. Never disappoints.
RexG,"Dined on December 6, 2011",5,"Excellent food, excellent wine list. Tables are small and very close to each other. Overall we had a great night and would certainly return if we have the opportunity."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 26, 2011",4,"Cute, romantic place to go for dinner. Great selection of wine. The squid ink rice with clams was amazing. Tapas style, so great for sharing with a couple close friends. Thumbs up!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 22, 2011",4,"Food was wonderful, helpful waiter. My only disappointment was that we were sat in a table, just around the corner from the door tucked by the side of the bar. The restaurant was very quiet so we were a little annoyed to be seated in the corner. Apart from that everything was great."
MKRCharlotte,"Dined on November 22, 2011",4,"Tiniest restaurant and jammed packed with tables. It seemed that there were more staff than patrons, but we still had trouble getting the waiter's attention sometimes. Luckily, the food was excellent. The duck egg and jamon offering was my favorite. We had five tapas among 3 people and left very satisfied - nice portions."
MarE,"Dined on November 20, 2011",4,"Service: for dinner, there are 2 seatings 5:30 + 7:30pm and/or 2 hour dining experience. not explained in anything i read but was told upon arrival. with dessert, we were a little beyond the 2 hour dining through no fault of ours. Food: The food is excellent, small portions so order about 2 to 3 dishes per person. Even the ""larger heartier"" portions are small and difficult to share. Ambiance: The rock music does not match the ambiance. With such a tight space, my friend kept getting hit by wait staff walking by. WIne: was reasonably priced and excellent."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 11, 2011",2,"Ear-splittingly loud (difficult to hear the person I was with), uncomfortably crowded (I was jostled every time a server attended to any of the tables next to me), undistinguished menu, ridiculously expensive. Other than that it was excellent."
Foodie123,"Dined on November 6, 2011",4,The food was delcious; however pricey. The tapas and entrees were excellent. Dessert was nothing special though. Service was good. Seating is very tight with small tables.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 4, 2011",5,"Casa Mono was even better than I remember it ... I visited this place with a friend a few years back and I decided to come back on my last trip to New York. Booked a table for lunch at 3pm and it was the best time to go -- service was great, probably because there was little traffic, but the food ... oh man, the food. It is hands down the best tapas place I've been to this side of the Atlantic. Please, please have the duck egg with jamon and truffles -- it will change your life!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 2, 2011",3,"My disappointment involved the food itself. I knew the bistro was Alsatian, but I didn't realize the food would be quite so heavy! Some of the dishes prized butter over actual flavor. So the food was rich without necessarily being complex."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 30, 2011",5,Casa Mono is one of the best restaurants in the best restaurant city in the world. Inventive tapas that taste better than anything you can get in Spain. Razor clams are to die for. Don't skip the bone marrow. My biggest regret that is that Casa Mono is not in SF where I live. I even spotted a place for it to replace one too many yoga studios.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 24, 2011",4,"This place had amazing food and service , only this last time I visited the restaurant we had this server that was chewing gum in or faces and made a face everytime we wanted something , next time will ask for Fernando, we always have a good time but when I had Fernando as a server it was great , plus their manager is very profesional , don't know his name but is the gentelman that comes around helping you choose your wine and he always understand your needs . This is a great place to visit just stay away the Skinni white blond guy with glasses ."
Wonderfulwino,"Dined on October 21, 2011",4,Excellent food and has been maintaining the high standards for years... A must for Spanish food lovers and wine aficiandos...
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 20, 2011",3,Very noisy small restaurant with tables almost touching each other. Tables awkward to get in and out of. Good choice of Spanish dishes with many centred around offal.
OhYumm,"Dined on October 16, 2011",4,"We loved our waitress. She was very competent and knew her wines and made a great recommendation for us. She guided us through the menue, which was diverse and extensive. Our tapas meal selection included sweet potato croquttes filled with goat cheese which had a light sweet/salty balance, a delicious pan roasted fish, a braised oxtail filled pepper in a wonderful light tomato sauce and a flavorful house made chorizo sausage. Lastly we had a creme burlee with the most amazing batter dipped and fried bay leaf. ( a bit unusual, but was delicious)The only thing we found a bit odd was the selection of music...it just didnt seem to fit the restaurant."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 15, 2011",4,Great place although a very little. Waiting at Bar Jamon makes the wait a little better.
Plovdinka,"Dined on October 15, 2011",4,The food was incredibly delicious-definitely not your ordinary tapas. Casa Mono serves the best foie gras I've had outside of Paris. The service was excellent and the wine list is extensive. Would recommend to anyone looking for a romantic date spot.
Gross,"Dined on October 14, 2011",3,"Food was good. Service was surprisingly unfriendly, even cold. Didn't have the best experience but will probably try again,"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 13, 2011",3,"It was a great place to grab a bite but nothing blew me away. A little pricey for the portions. I get it, its a ""tapas"" place, but they're charging entree prices."
ACRY,"Dined on October 13, 2011",3,"Great, but SMALL. Too small. Kinda always makes you feel like you're in the way. Wine list is awesome, all Spanish, but a bit hard to understand and I wasn't thrilled with the white wine recommendation we got. Bottle seemed off, but I didn't know the grape or producer well enough to be sure. Food is incredible though."
CalifCondor1234,"Dined on October 12, 2011",4,"Very, very good food, tasty, creative preparations and thoughtfully combinations. The brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had"
anNY,"Dined on October 12, 2011",2,"I don't like when a restaurant claims to have the real thing and give you something different than the name indicates. They use Spanish names (from Spain) to call an American version of the food. Sepia is sepia and not calamari, etc. Expensive, pretentious and deceiving. Not a good experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 11, 2011",4,"Casa Mono was a very interesting meal which while I greatly enjoyed it, I cannot recommend it to everyone. You must be an adventurous eater to truly appreciate many of the options. I really enjoyed the sepia and the rabbit, while the my friend found her choices to be limited by her tastes. As a tapas style restaurant this becomes problematic as some people may want to try dishes which others do not. If you have a group who loves food and are willing to eat ANYTHING then Casa Mono would be a great choice."
RunsInHeels,"Dined on October 10, 2011",5,LOVE this place!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 10, 2011",5,Razor clams and head-on shrimp were insane!
AvaE,"Dined on October 9, 2011",5,"What a true gem! We sat at the chef's table (best seats in the house!) and were treated to a wonderful display of cooking talent. It was better than watching a cooking show on TV. Our server was very attentive and helpful with our food choices and wine selections. The menu was very creative. All the dishes coming out from the tiny kitchen looked delicious and virtuously presented. Unfortunately we couldn't sample all of them, we wish we could have. Make sure you make reservations as it is a small place and fills up quickly. That being said, we never felt rushed and it was a fantastic dining experience."
DeliaG,"Dined on October 6, 2011",5,Tom Colichio from Top Chef was dining there!!!
Greenwichfoodie57,"Dined on October 4, 2011",1,"What a huge disappointment. The service was rude and rushed, which was ridiculous since the restaurant was almost empty. Any question we asked about the wines or menu seemed to be annoying to the waiter who could not conceal his boredom with his job. The food was below average, very salty. The lack of properly trained waiters was shocking for a Batali restaurant, especially one that is not gaining much traction."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 3, 2011",5,"My Fiance and I celebrated our 7th and final dating anniversary here! It was the perfect spot to celebrate such a special day. The restaurant is small and romantic. Norah Jones was softly playing in the background. All of the small plates are DELICIOUS and I loved how when the food arrived all of the other tables would flirt with our entrees to see if they need to order anything else! The skirt steaks was our favorite. Apparently the sweetbreads are Amazing, but they were out of them. Loved my wine, the food, and the ambiance! Will definitely go back and will also be trying the wine bar next door soon- Bar Jamon!"
ArtRios,"Dined on September 29, 2011",1,"Don't even bother. If you are a true/hardcore Tapas fan, this is not the place for you. Those that do not know true Spanish Tapas may like the ""creative"" approach taken by Casa Mono. But, if not, do not waste your time at this place. The service was fair, the wine list varied and interesting, but it just saddens me to say that I shall not return."
ClaudiaH,"Dined on September 28, 2011",4,"the table wasn't ready when we arrived and had to wait for 1/2 hour, which is great for them because they send you next door to the Jamon Bar! Nonetheless, the food was very good, even if the tables are small and you don't have lots of personal space. I would recommend it, but probably best for groups in even numbers (there was 3 of us in a table for 2!)"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 27, 2011",4,"For our first night in NY we chose Casa Mono. The noise level was fairly high and the space was so tight that when a diner at the next table knocked her wine over it fell on our table. The staff was quick, and competent, and we barely missed a beat.  For the food we started with the Pumpkin and Goat Cheese Croquetas and the Dorada with Fennel puree. The croquetas were terrific; and the Dorada tasted alright but was cool, but that might have been due to the wine mishap. These were followed by the Pork Chop and the Chorizo. Both nicely seasoned and cooked perfectly. The pork chop's presentation was simple but it did not detract. We shared a Chocolate Torta and enjoyed it immensely.  The staff were attentive & helpful. All in all a good ni"

Squeaky,"Dined on August 31, 2011",5,"Loved the choices on the menu, our waiter was able to guide us and gave excellent advice. The wine was superb, a pinot noir from Spain."
StacyJ,"Dined on August 29, 2011",5,"I live in San Diego, but when I'm in New York I try to come here for lunch every visit. The food is fabulous if you like Spanish flavors. I am a big fan of Batali's restaurants because he tends towards the simple but intense flavors. Dinner is good, but much more crowded and noisy (it is a very small space), so a late lunch is wonderful as the tables are not filled, the noise is minimal and the staff is attentive. Because the restaurant is on a corner with west and south exposures, light is good no matter the weather despite the ochre tones which are quite appropriate to the cuisine. Between the 5 of us, with varied tastes, everyone raved about every one of the 12 tapas we ordered. I could go on, but space will not allow. Just go!"
Brunch,"Dined on August 22, 2011",1,"DON'T BOTHER! The restaurant has a policy that all guests must be present to be seated. In the torential downpour this past Sunday, one of our party arrived early. The hostess did not let her come in the restaurant and made her wait outside in the rain! The tables are miniscule and you MUST order 2 items per person. There are wine glasses, bread/butter, silverware and plates on the table before the food arrives. We were juggling plates the whole time. What was worse, was that we asked for a larger table and were told it was ""reserved"". No one sat there the entire time we were there. The food was good, but I can sit at a larger table at Big Daddy's without the attitude. How Mario Batali can put his name on this place leaves me bafle"
FoodWineChickie,"Dined on August 20, 2011",4,"Casa Mono was great as always. Love the whole tapas concept and sharing dishes allows you to experience a slew of dishes instead of just one. Service is cold and a bit stuck up, but the food and the amazing wine list make up for it, somehow."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 19, 2011",4,Impressed with the quality of service and the atmosphere. The food was very good too and I look forward to going back to try more of the menu...

NancyC,"Dined on August 8, 2011",4,"One of the best meals I've had, ever. The small plates allowed you to share and experience multiple dishes. The tastes and textures of each dish were very unique. We especially enjoyed the duck, rabbit and scallops. The bread pudding was the wonderful; I loved the crunchy sugar top coat! Space is very limited (scrunchy) and the music was very (too) loud."
LisaNas,"Dined on July 31, 2011",4,excellent food in a small restaurant located in Gramacy Park- excellent Tapas and wine
Classic,"Dined on July 30, 2011",3,They need to get a full liquor license and lower the prices a bit. The value factor is a bit on the lean side even given the quality of the food.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 29, 2011",2,"Really disappointed with the bartender (we ate at the bar). He rushed us out: repeatedly checked the bill folder to see if we had put a card down to pay, sighed impatiently when we hadn't. Threw out my dining companion's wine- which she wasn't finished with. About as far from gracious as you can get. Will not return."
EllenD,"Dined on July 24, 2011",4,"Although the food was good, it was way too hot!!! The space is way too small."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 19, 2011",4,"Casa Mono never disappoints. Consistently excellent food. I especially love their sweetbreads, bone marrow and whole sepia."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 17, 2011",5,"We had our usual delicious meal here. Although our server was fairly new, she answered our questions about some items on the menu and was knowledgeable about the wines. Two of us enjoyed three dishes, which was plenty for lunch. The chaceuterie plate was fabulous with small tastes of four different meat preparations; the softshell crab sandwich fresh and tasty, and the pumpkin-goat cheese fritters perfectly fried, crisp and not greasy at all. Because we went for a late lunch, the room wasn't as full as usual, making for a quieter experience than usual."
idine,"Dined on July 15, 2011",4,"The food was excellent! Each dish is well thought out and executed. The kitchen organizes your menu thoughtfully, such that a balance of flavors and pairings work well. The only downfall is that the seating is terribly uncomfortable and cramped. I was thankful that the dishes arrived promptly so we could eat and get out of there. Too bad since the food is so good I would have loved to linger and savor more."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 12, 2011",5,Spectacular tapas -- and wonderful wine.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 5, 2011",4,"Food was very good as usual. Only disappointment is that many of the menu items have not changed in two year...though they did have 2 specials which we ordered and they were excellent. It was busy, but the service was a bit spotty and we were sat at the very tight corner of the restaurant, but it is a very small and crowded restaurant. We always prefer the chef's table, but it was fully loaded this time around. Casa Mono still offer wonderful flavor and varieties and will keep us returning for many more times."
WorldDiner,"Dined on July 2, 2011",3,"I love this restaurant for their food and amazing Spanish wines. We were there twice in the winter but summer was great because they open all the doors so it is almost seemed like you were outside. I thought the wait staff was really rude this time, though. Not sure if they were upset to be working on a beautiful Sat afternoon, but it was a huge turnoff. They need to be more aware of their clients."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 2, 2011",4,"Really excellent food. We shared six things. The duck egg is great, a play on eggs, bacon and potatoes, but you'll not get food like this at a diner! Also had the croquettes, the rabbit, the goat, soft-shell crab, chorizo. As I said, it's all good. Will definitely go back."
JohnB,"Dined on June 27, 2011",4,Batali adds another gem to his empire. Tapas size plates but prices are midway between an appetizer and an entree. Great food but just don't eat too much if you need to take a cab home.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 18, 2011",5,"This was a great find. The food was great. A tapas style menu with huge choice. We tried a variety of dishes including some amazing duck with cherry's, melt in your mouth! I also loved the beet and strawberry dish. It was great to try a number of small dishes to share rather than just one big dish each. My husband love loved the lamb ribs with chickpea salad."
Gigi,"Dined on June 17, 2011",3,"It was fun, the food was okay but not what we had anticipated. The service was great."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 17, 2011",3,Excellent food. Cramped space and everything small. Hugely noisy with loud music over poor acoustics. Hard to hear.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 8, 2011",4,Second visit. Food still delicious and interesting. Service noticeably improved.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 4, 2011",2,"This is the only time I have ever been disappointed by a Michelin star restaurant. We had a group of four celebrating a birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is small but was relatively empty. Our server was extremely slow and not very attentive. The food is priced like typical American enrtres but, the protions are just slightly larger than most American version tapas. Aside from being over-priced, the food was just average, definitely not Michelin quality. My wife grew up in Spain and we still visit family there often. Spain has some of the best food on the planet but, you won't find it here. Next time in NYC, we will take the train to Ironbound in Newark for great Spanish cuisine."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 4, 2011",2,"I really felt at a tapas bar in Spain, all the dishes were amazing. I rated fair the overall experience fair due to the service (in specific one waiter) i will recommend this restaurant to a friend with the condition to request a different waiter."
todds,"Dined on June 3, 2011",4,"Excellent tapas, a must is the razor clams. Seating was excessively tight in the corner but looked good otherwise."
LGeats,"Dined on May 30, 2011",5,"My boyfriend and I went to Casa Mona on a Sunday night recently. Even on a Sunday at 6 p.m. the restaurant was busy with people, all seeming to enjoy their meals. The wait staff was attentive and the waiter took a lot of time to answer our questions, describe his favorite dishes and even tell me how they made one of their items that I particularly liked. We had 6 tapas all of which were excellent and 2 desserts that were outstanding. In the summer, the restaurant is open giving it an indoor/outdoor feel that is really nice especially when the weather is pleasant. Overall, it was a great dining experience and one I would love to do again soon."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 29, 2011",4,"Excellent food. Have been going to Casa Mono for years. The best seats are at the bar where you can watch everyone's food being prepared. Two annoying elements: First, the wait staff has been trained to push diner's into ordering all of their food at one time. Ignore the waiter when pushed and enjoy tapas the way they are supposed to be enjoyed -- one or two at a time. The second annoyance is the Spanish menu. Not everyone knows that, for example, setas are mushrooms. The wait staff will translate but who wants to order with the waiter hovering over you shoulder. The restaurant should have a little less arrogance and print the menu on a longer page with an English translation line added under the Spanish entries."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 28, 2011",3,"Need an Opentable option ""Great for Hobbits"" because Casa Mono certainly would be. The food and service were very good, but the uncomfortable seating took away from the dining experience. Specifically, the tables (at least the one we had) are very low, and my legs were sandwiched between the chair and the table."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 23, 2011",3,arrived early told our table was still occupied and would be free on time sent us next door to the bar they would call us called back in five minutes it was not the table we were shown as requested next to the window sat in the middle of the restaurant very uncomfortable
alakeev,"Dined on May 22, 2011",5,innovative and adventurous menu - totally enjoyed it!!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 21, 2011",5,Spectacular find! A dinner to remember!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 20, 2011",3,"Went to Casa Mono last night. All in all the meal was good, but not amazing. Our server was very friendly and informative, he assisted when necessary but did not linger annoyingly. The wine list was excellent. However, one of the hostesses with glasses was not too friendly, and when I made the reservation on the phone, whomever I spoke to was not so friendly either (could've been the same person.)"
deanas,"Dined on May 14, 2011",3,"Food was amazing, service was stuffy and made us a little uncomfortable. It would have been nice to be able a good time with great food for an early get together without the feeling that we shouldn't be having a good time (the server seemed strict and upset about having us for his table, although our bill was nearly $200 for a happy hour/snack get together for 4 people)."
jin49,"Dined on May 9, 2011",4,"Cramped, crowded, but very good food. The food is a myriad of interesting combinations of small plates."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 9, 2011",5,"Food here is excellent. I particularly like the razor clams, pumpkin & goat cheese croquettes, patatas bravas, and pulpo. Very savory."
textilegirl,"Dined on May 8, 2011",3,"I have been to casa mono many times and on this particular occasion, the maitre d was extremely rude. I had requested a corner table for Mother's Day and the maitre d tried to seat us at a table WITH other guests. When I explained my notes in the reservation he rudely accepted that they were there but he couldn't give us a corner table. We waited for more than 30 minutes after to get an individual table. In general the service was slow on that day but the food was as good as always. I would have hoped that since I was there for Mother's Day with my mother they could have treated us a bit more kindly."
zephyr221,"Dined on May 8, 2011",4,"Tables were a little bit too on top of each other for my liking. Service was ok; should have been more attentive for such a tiny location. Food was top notch, though."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 5, 2011",5,The food was excellent and the service was impeccable! Will definitely visit again!
nySteakLove,"Dined on April 30, 2011",4,The restaurant is little small but the dishes are so great! I will be back.
Steve,"Dined on April 25, 2011",4,This is the second time (we returned) we went here at our NYC visit. Excellent selection and very tasty tapas style restaurant.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 24, 2011",3,"Nice, but too expensive for what it is."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 20, 2011",3,Great spot for tapas. Consistent. It's small of course so be sure to do the res thing. Iberian pig and their own Cava? C'mon! Very nice. Only one negative. The waiter wanted the whole order up front. Impossible when eating tapas. Will not stop me from making Mono a regular stop.
108NYC,"Dined on April 19, 2011",4,"Wonderful, sophisticated 'little plates' tapas, with ingredients to meet any foodies expectation: quail, octopus, sweatbreads, fennel, sardines, pork belly, etc. Definitely recommend. and definitely recommend reservations there are very few tables."
MartinV,"Dined on April 13, 2011",5,"Still my favorite restaurant in Manhattan. A few months back, they were not serving the razor clams for one reason or the other, and I think I want into a slight depression. Came back this week to take my sister from out of town (she asked I take her there since she loved it last time she visited), and they had recently revised the menu, but kept the dependable favorites on there. As usual, the razor clams were sublime, and the sweet breads did not disappoint. We must have had about 7-8 small dishes (we were a group of 3) and a special mention to the muscles with chorizo which I hadn't tried out yet and will be one of my staples from now. Of course, the downside is that you have to reserve a few weeks out for a WEEKDAY spot. Oh well..."
Foodie,"Dined on March 25, 2011",5,"This is like going to Barcelona without the hassle of a long flight. If I didn't love Lupa so much, I would've tried this place years earlier (there is only so much time to pack in old favorites and try new places). The octopus and razor clams a la plancha are phenomenal!"
GMAC,"Dined on March 20, 2011",4,Space is tight as tables are very close together. Luckily we were next two tables with very nice couples. Made some new friends that we are planning on meeting next month at one of Mario's wine tastings. Food was very good. The small plates give you an opportunity to venture into dishes that you would not normally try in larger portions. We will be back!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 12, 2011",4,"Casa Mono was a great restaurant. Our party ordered 9 different tapas: razor clams, mussels & chorizo, chorizo & cabbage, shrimp, pork belly, lamb shank, bone marrow, pumpkin/goat cheese and the duck egg. The dishes ranged from good to excellent. Prices were not outrageous, but were on the high end. The place is SMALL, so be sure to make a reservation. Definitely worth a visit."
may091,"Dined on March 12, 2011",4,"Great tapas with extensive wine list! The best dishes were the bruschetta and brussels sprouts! The cheese and pumpkin croquettes weren't as good as expected! The dishes were all full and rich with flavor! We were seated almost as soon as our entire party arrived, tho the service could have been better overall."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 12, 2011",1,"The quality and composition of their 'tapas' is the poorest that I have experienced in ANY restaurant involved in Spanish cuisine, or even high cookery in general. The one Michelin star status creates expectations that this restaurant definitely does not meet."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 10, 2011",4,Excellent experience and great food
JessicaM,"Dined on February 28, 2011",2,"Overall, I was a little disappointed in the food. Everything just seemed a little bland and unremarkable. The service was attentive, which I alway appreciate. However, even at 6:00 p.m. on a Sunday night, it was so loud and cramped that it was difficult to have a conversation. I think that this place is for the ""see and be seen"" crown rather than the foodie crowd"
Beerandmeat,"Dined on February 22, 2011",4,"A small cute restaurant. Had the seta mushrooms, sweetbreads, fideos, calamari with pork meatballs, and cod cheeks. Overall good and very interesting dishes with unique ways of using ingredients. Wasn't blown away by anything except the mushrooms, though, and quite expensive for tapas. Was expecting a bit more, but i had very high expectations. Worth a try though."
Chewzy,"Dined on February 22, 2011",4,We always eat here when we are in new York. It is one of our favorites and we are never disappointed. The food is interesting and exciting. Makes me want to get on the next flight to Spain.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 21, 2011",4,"Went for a late lunch; reservations are tough here as this place is good and popular. Service was good but uneven. Food, though, was fantastic. The pumpkin fritters, amazing, fois gras, delicious, flank steak, wonderful, chorizo, mouthwatering, stuffed peppers, delectable and the sundae, fabulous. And, although the restaurant was a bit tight and uncomfortable, I can't wait to go again."
Boskid,"Dined on February 20, 2011",3,Very cramped restaurant which makes you initially uncomfortable. The food is excellent but very small portions at a very high price. Some reasonably priced wines by the bottle. Overall given other options this is a very good choice especially for lunch when it is less crowded
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 17, 2011",2,"Rush is their motto , really bad experience , too bad , food and service used to be better, we'll not come back."
realhungry,"Dined on February 14, 2011",4,Expensive given the small plates. Good for a special occasion. Lamb shank is my favorite. Service is excellent.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 7, 2011",2,"Excellent food, good ambiance, unexpectedly horrendous service."
Mork,"Dined on February 6, 2011",5,"As always, a gastronomic experience: a must for anyone who loves tapas. A note regarding the wines: rosados go very well with tapas and the Bermejo is definitely worth a try"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 5, 2011",4,expensive but the food is so good!
Bmiger,"Dined on February 4, 2011",3,"The food at Casa Mono is still very good, but isn't as consistent as it once was. Example: Mussels with chorizo came to the table in a sauce that was not cooked long enough, so it was acidic and spicy with no flavor. Best to eat lunch there, as dinner is extremely noisy no matter when you arrive. Plates are pulled away too quickly at dinner, even when there is no one waiting for a table."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 30, 2011",3,"I was dissappointed in Casa Mono. The croquetas, of both pork and cod, which were suggested by our server as a specialty, were bland. The brussels sprouts - which I know from my own cooking become sweet and tender when roasted - were charred but undercooked. It's a cozy place for a glass of wine and a bite or two, but not a meal."
VWhite,"Dined on January 29, 2011",5,"My fiancé and I wanted to try one of Mario Batali's restaurants for quite some time now and we chose Casa Mono because of our love for tapas. The evening couldn't have gone better!! The food is top shelf, our waiter was excellent; actually the entire staff was excellent! The wine list is extensive and all Italian so if you don't know your Italian wines you should brush up on that, however, the bar next door is a great place to try a glass while you wait for your reservation. We will definitely be returning to try the rest of the menu out and I would highly recommend this restaurant to any of my friends or co-workers."
louvg,"Dined on January 23, 2011",4,My only complaint is that the restaurant is very small so it is very cramped inside. Food however was fabulous!
JClem,"Dined on January 23, 2011",4,"menu was creative and very representative of spain, the pork belly was delicious, service attentive. tables were alittle too crammed, not a problem in warm weather when restaurant can be opened up."
WorldDiner,"Dined on January 22, 2011",5,This was my first time at Casa Mono and it won't be my last. I really enjoyed the menu and the wine list that included only Spanish wines. The wines by the glass were very interesting and the pours were very generous. I particularly enjoyed the grilled octopus and braised lamb shank! The wait staff was very friendly and professional. Loved it!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 21, 2011",3,"Loved the food! It was so, so good, and authentic. Unfortunately the wait staff was NOT so good or attentive and spent more time talking to each other instead of making sure we didn't want or need anything else. At one point we wanted to order a couple of more items and had to get up and get our waiter's attention."
LindaF,"Dined on January 19, 2011",4,"Warm friendly service, varied and excellent choices on menu.. Dining area is small and cramped, designed for a quick turnover in tables not for leisurely dining."
StefaniaK,"Dined on January 18, 2011",4,"The attraction is the food - very flavorful and inventive. New additions and seasonal choices are great. Its a crowded, noisy place --- expect brunch/lunch to be a quieter, calmer dining experience. Its unique menu makes it really attractive - the service can be very attentive to uninterested & the tables are really too tight for the dinner traffic..."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 11, 2011",5,"I ordered a cheap wine bottle and they gave me one triple the price. Other than that, the food was amazing."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 31, 2010",4,It's become a tradition for us to go for my brother's birthday. Great menu! Great service!
Champagnetaste,"Dined on December 28, 2010",5,The food was fantastic. Our servers were helpful selecting food and wine. Going at 3:30 pm was perfect. Not crowded and more relaxed than at dinner-time when you are shoulder to shoulder. Can't be beat!
dineout,"Dined on December 27, 2010",3,"We've had tapas all over and from reading the reviews, we had high hopes.  It's just okay and nothing special.  But it's a fun place to eat."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2010",3,The food is very different at Casa Mono but also very good. We enjoyed our food but not the service. It was very rushed. The waiter would not allow any additional tapas orders after the initial order and tried to push us to order more at the start of the meal. We will not go back to Casa Mono as the waiter made our experience unpleasent.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 18, 2010",4,Everything made to order. Great food. Will recommend.
Nyc10029,"Dined on December 10, 2010",4,Really good food...but they need to work on the service. Staff not overly friendly...
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 10, 2010",4,Casa Mono is really incredible. mario Batali never dissapoints! If you are lucky enough to get a table....indulge in incredible tapas with a twist!
paris27,"Dined on December 6, 2010",4,"The food, the wine and the service were amazing.  We had a reservation and had to wait outside for 15 minutes on a 30 degree day which was not ideal. ANd one, additional note - the classic rock music they were playing was wayyy too loud/heavy for a Sunday afternoon brunch."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 5, 2010",4,just a great lunch place. the house wine is superb the food well prepared highly recommend a little pricey but worth it.
DEKKOR,"Dined on December 5, 2010",5,What can we say ....great Job M.Batalia.... Great food and great service !!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 4, 2010",4,The portions were perfect for the food. They were just enough to satify without being to small leaving you wanting more or to large that you felt bad about eating it all or throwing it away. Very good wine selection. Service staff very helpful in offering advise.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 1, 2010",5,Casa Mono is now my favorite NYC restaraunt. The tapas menu allows for a sampling of many items for 2 people. Every dish we have was a new favor experience.
JeanF,"Dined on November 28, 2010",3,"We are Batali lovers although we were not that impressed with Casa Mono. It is small plates/tapas style. We were there for lunch and ordered the bacala fritters which we swear was mashed potatoes - no sign of Bacala in there. Sardines and scallops were good, not great. Skirt Steak was good but nothing different. Wine list was expensive. It was about $30 more expensive than we are used to at Lupa which wouldn't have been an issue if it was as great."
papi,"Dined on November 24, 2010",2,"Ok, it was Thanksgiving Day. Ok, it was a lazy lunch time. So, what's to be so critical about it? Relax. The staff being reasonably and seasonably relaxed is not a sin, even in a socalled ""hot spot"". End of the niceties. Bluntly put: who was minding the store? There is a difference between being relaxed and being asleep from the moment the customer enters the restaurant up to the moment he leaves. No sin, of course. But if the food is involved in the overall catatonia, it is time for some questions. Bye bye Mono."
Mork,"Dined on November 20, 2010",5,"I keep returning to Casa Mono for some very simple reasons: the tapas are outstanding,the staff is friendly, yet professional, and the wines are diverse. In addition the overall experience always seems to be a positive one in terms of the joy of dining. So i'll keep returning and likely will keep saying nice things about it. Kudos to the entire operation!"
HWeil,"Dined on November 7, 2010",3,"Glorious cooking is badly compromised by loud music that requires conversation to be even louder, by slow service, and by the tightest seating in New York (the wait staff couldn't help jostling my chair every time someone passed; eating the excellent sardines made me feel like a cannibal). Too bad, because the food is top-notch."
A1inLV,"Dined on November 5, 2010",3,"We enjoyed it, but did not think it wasgreat"
BonnieJeanne,"Dined on November 4, 2010",4,"Casa Mono was great, the only thing I would note is that it is not a romantic place. With the Michelin Star/great food/great chef/big prices for some reason we thought it would be a little more romantic. It was fantastic and delicious, just not what we expected, a little crowded for a special occasion. Also, great Spanish wine list, but our waitress was not very knowledgable."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 3, 2010",4,Try the Patatas bravas and the Sardines!
DSHfromNWK,"Dined on October 29, 2010",4,"I've only been to Casa Mono twice--I realize that for affluent New Yorkers this restaurant would be a casual place to dine, but for me the price range means this is special occasion dining. I brought my best friend for his birthday. The food was phenomenal! I love the variety of options on the menu: we had goat cheese and squash croquettes, scallops, mackerel, lamb shank, oxtail, and goat. The mackerel, lambshank and oxtail were the standouts. We each had a cuarto of red wine; both were delicious. For dessert, he had the chocolate torte and I had the bread pudding. They were both scrumptious, although we thought the portions were small for the price. Expect tight quarters here as the restaurant is small and they use all the space."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 25, 2010",5,The pork belly is to die for and all of the dishes we ate were prepared with care and tasted superb
COLDTablecustomer,"Dined on October 24, 2010",1,"Casa Mono was simply horrible. Unfriendly staff, not enough space, tiny tables, mediocre food and too much time between dishes and totally overpriced. We do not recommend this restaurant to any one who has tasted real Spanish food before."
KurtF,"Dined on October 21, 2010",3,Somewhat condescending service. Excellent choice of tapas dishes but some have gone a little stale. A notice a decline. Almost sherrified white wine--which can be enjoyed but ought to be singled out from regular--was offered with no advance notice.
ChrisE,"Dined on October 19, 2010",4,"Dinner was great, each dish was carefully preapred and all were delicious. Mario Batailli even pulled up right outside on his scooter, orange crocs and all, and came inside to sit with some folks for a while. My only compliant would be that we would have liked to have probably done a second bottle of wine and ordered a little slower, but we were asked to place all of our order at once. Part of the beauty of tapas/small plates is trying this and that as you go along. Having to place the order at once, somewhat rushed the meal. While maybe this is something you need to do on a Friday or Saturday, this was a Monday night and the table next to us was empty until we left. But, this wouldn't keep me from coming back."
Malvolio,"Dined on October 14, 2010",4,"When I've been to Casa Mono for dinner, it has usually been packed and crowded. At lunch time, it is far more sedate. Oddly Open Table indicated no availability at 12:30 p.m. but the restaurant was half empty. The food as always was terrific, and the wait staff helpful."
thepurplestain,"Dined on October 11, 2010",3,"Food at Casa Mono was very good. Service was good. The noise level was not to my liking. Rock and roll played so loudly the server had a difficult time hearing us and I enjoy the Black Crows. I would suggest Spanish music since it is a Spanish restaurant. The atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, kind of dumpy looking on the inside. While the wine list is quite extensive, the restaurant really gouges the clientele. Mark-up on the wines exceeded 300 percent."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 8, 2010",2,"Nice restaurant, very good food even though slightly expensive for the area. the place is not that big so the table are a little bit too close from each other Service is good but not very attentive."
1CYNICALDINER,"Dined on October 8, 2010",3,"4 ""little plates"", dessert, one of their cheapest bottles of wine? NOT priceless, over rated and over priced, $200 +. In this economy? Kudos if they can keep it up. Although the service was very good, the dishes were just OK and left us unsatisfied. While I appreciate striving for authenticity, you are in America people, we don't read Italian, at least put English descriptions of the food below the Italian! Also called to see if we could add two to our party (more revenue for you, Mr. Batali & Co.) and move it back 1/2 hour, said they were full and couldn't accomodate us, yet there were at least two tables open the entire time we were there."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 28, 2010",5,"It was extraordinary. We have been to Spain many times and found the food at Casa Mono just as if we were eating in Madrid, Barcelona, or any Spanish city. Excellent service and prices were very reasonable. We stopped first at the bar next door and the tapas were just incredible. Will definitely go back whenever we are in New York. From 1 to 10, our experience was 11."
CarmenG,"Dined on September 24, 2010",5,"It was awesome! The food was really good. We really enjoyed the place and the food. Best dinner during our vacations in NYC. We are from Mexico and Australia and our family background is spanish, so we definetly know about spanish cuisine, and yours was outstanding. Thank you very much and congratulations!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 22, 2010",5,Loved every morsel. Only fresh ingredients are used. I licked everything off the plate.
Naiad,"Dined on September 16, 2010",3,"The four dishes my friend and I shared were tasty and inventive. We both really enjoyed the pulpo and the goat cheese/watermelon salad, and the dessert, the Mono sundae, was delicious. There's a really extensive and good wine list. The negative is the tiny tables and extremely close quarters, although the design of the tables and the layout makes the most of the tiny square footage."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 14, 2010",4,Everything was delicious!  Will definitely go again......
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 12, 2010",4,"slight step below last time, but who knows may have been an off night. Still excellent."
sksun,"Dined on September 12, 2010",4,Very cosy and the food was excellent ---
ChantalA,"Dined on September 9, 2010",5,"It was definitely worth the effort to make arrangements in advance. This restaurant, as well as the attached Bar Jamon, are on our ""can't miss"" list - we will recommend to anyone and everyone, and will be back ourselves without a doubt. The food was incredible: pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas, cana de cabra and watermelon salad, mussels with cava and chorizo, scallops with tomatillos con pepitas, duck breast with peach mostaza, pork belly with sweet corn and sandia, yunquera, and sorbet and sweet wine for dessert. All to die for. The atmosphere was cozy - not an ounce of extra space to be had - but lively and energetic. The service was attentive and prompt. Come here for incredible food and wine, but not for a private conversation."
Steve,"Dined on September 6, 2010",4,This is a seriously good tapas bar. High quality food. The sweetbread choice was out of this world. All be it seating is like in a sardine can.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 2, 2010",1,"Didn't like the food, very small tables."
MarH,"Dined on August 28, 2010",4,"The food at Casa Mono was outstanding, as always. The biggest drawback of the place is that it's tiny and is always packed. If there are only 2 of you, opt to sit at the bar (watching them cook is a treat and there's more room than at many tables). Had some fried goat cheese and a great salad, the skirt steak is fantastic, the scallops were good but not my favorite thing there; also had some good grilled artichokes and the bread pudding dessert was excellent. They have a nice wine list. Service, as always, was phenomenal--all the servers are friendly, attentive and knowledgable about both the menu items and the wine list. Mono can get a little pricey for a ""regular"" dinner out but I think it's worth it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 22, 2010",5,"The food was amazing. We tried 6 different tapas and all were fabulous. The only problem is the small size and our 1pm Sunday lunch date was perfect as it wasn't very crowded yet. While I understand the reason for having to order everything at once, I was disappointed we couldn't order one thing to curb our hunger while we agreed to what we wanted to order."
ElisaE,"Dined on August 22, 2010",4,"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! Great service, unbelievable food, and good wine. Best desserts we have ever eaten. The restaurant is small but I never felt cramped."
JoyB,"Dined on August 21, 2010",4,we love dining at Casa Mono! the food is amazingly prepared and the wine list is extensive.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 15, 2010",3,"The restaurant offers very good food and an extensive wine list. It is a very small place with little room to maneuver, and it get a bit uncomfortable."
papi,"Dined on August 14, 2010",3,"The food is generally above average, with the surprising exception of the available shell fish, which certainly does not reach high standards of excellence. The service is fairly pretentious, we shall see if the waiters will change their attitude when this hot spot falls from grace. Patience is the name of the game."
graceb,"Dined on August 11, 2010",2,"This is advertised as kid friendly but it's not. There isn't anything really on the menu for small children. The waiter suggested pasta without the sauce or mussels. It was, in the end, plain pasta. Guess what, it costs $18 to eat plain pasta at Casa Mono. I know it's New York but that was extraordinarily expensive. The foie gras and the fried pork belly were delicious. The fried pumpkin filled with goat cheese were overly breaded and over cooked. It was a good experience, though. I wouldn't recommend that anyone with a small child go there. The portions are also appetizer size. 3 or 4 orders per adult would satisfy an appetite."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 11, 2010",3,"Very cramped place but overall experience, the food was ok-to moderately good. I find other tapas place much more authentic and better."
DJ12,"Dined on August 10, 2010",4,The food was great but the restaurant was too loud. The music was deafening at times - had trouble hearing our dining companions.
NickB,"Dined on August 9, 2010",4,"Casa Mono never fails to deliver. Tight seating, but adds to ambiance. Food combinations and flavors are worth the visit."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 5, 2010",2,"The food was great. The service was terrible, the waiters were more interested in pushing the tab higher than giving advice. Great food but you can not let the waiters intimiate you. After we order the first round of 6 dishes the waiter said in a nasty tone ""thats not enough food"" We asked for wine recommendations Sommelier pointed to a group of wines starting at $150 bottle, when I suggested that was a bit high he said that was all he had that met my comments and left me to pick something on my own."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 2, 2010",4,The menu was totally done in Spanish and wasn't broken up into groups or types of tapas so be prepared to ask questions about the selections. The wine list was also quite extensive but there was a sommelier on hand to help pair the food with the wine.
Mary,"Dined on August 2, 2010",5,"Casa Mono is a very special place. The tapas (small plates) are outstanding here: the duck comes served 5 different ways including sweetbreads, the crispy mackerel is served over a roasted eggplant puree that could be a dish in its own right, the lamb chops with rosemary rub are first-rate, and the oxtail stew is phenomenal. Even better--the wine list is a true expression of the variety of Spanish wines, and the wait staff are friendly, willing and able to help you find the best matches for particular dishes. Many wines are available as quartos--enough for 2 glasses--so you can try different wines with your food if you enjoy that kind of culinary experimentation. This place is a real gem for foodies and wine lovers alike!"
RichardC,"Dined on August 1, 2010",2,"food was quite good, but the wait staff & host were rather pretentious & not very accommodating... it's rare that the service detracts from such good food, but alas casa mono's service did."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 31, 2010",5,"We had a memorable evening with great friends. Service was fantastic, loved the wine. Menu offered something for everyone; one that was the finicky, one not so excited about seafood and 2 adventures. Loved that it was not a trip to a celebrity chef's"" Disney World"", but a great little restuarant to share great food with great friends on a Summer evening. Great time was had by all! Try the Scallops and Razor Clams!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 30, 2010",5,This is my second time here and defiantly not the last. Love the food
Vixvegas,"Dined on July 30, 2010",5,"This tiny Batali addition to his array of great establishments offers a unique menu of tasty tapas. Each item is a clever twist on traditional Spanish small plates and each is delicious and flavorful. Don't miss the patatas bravas (spiced potatoes) or the skirt steak which is tender and incredibly flavorful, sliced to be shared. There are only a few tables but energy and flavor abound and the counter seating offers a chance to see the artistic chefs at work. Great place to visit for a small group who love great food."
DaveW,"Dined on July 28, 2010",5,"I sometimes feel that this is my favorite restaurant in the city. I love Spain: the food, culture, and wine. Casa Mono delivers on all of those things.  I really can't say enough.  Just go. Drink some wine. Eat some tapas."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 27, 2010",3,"love the food, great for couples/adults. not very children friendly: 2/2 times some of the staff had issues with our - well behaved! - kids."
LaFleur,"Dined on July 26, 2010",5,"The food was phenomenal, especially the Hudson Valley pork menu. Also plenty of options for non-meateaters. We sat at the bar and watched the open kitchen; a fascinating way to enjoy the experience. Three dishes per person was the perfect amount of food. Can't wait to go back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 22, 2010",4,"A bit of a disappointing 2nd visit (only a week after my first) - maybe expectations were too high? Food is good, but it'd be great if they could change the menu up a bit every now and then... Service isn't the best here (I usually don't care about service if the food is good).. our waiter wasn't very friendly, didn't explain which dishes he was bringing out (there was a substitution), and rushed us out blatantly."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 22, 2010",5,Every dish was so delicious and equally well executed. Amazing food!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 20, 2010",2,"Overall, the food was good, but a bit greasy (ex. duck egg w/ potatoes & blk truffles), and salty (ex. romesco) Also, the pumpkin with goat cheese balls were dry and over fried -seemed like they came out of a frozen food box. The steak over the romesco was cooked nicely, the bread con tomate was perfect & the meat free Monday veggie special was very good."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 18, 2010",5,"My husband and I went for our anniversary and absolutely LOVED IT!! We are big foodies and Casa Mono came recommended to us. The place was small, empty when we arrived at 5:30 but packed by the time we left at 7:30. Very loud and almost a little too intimate, we felt as if we were dining with the 2 other couples next to us. You couldn't help but be part of each others conversations. Razor clams rocked as did the scallops, lobster, and calamari with pork meatballs. I'd skip the chorizo with sumer beans, too much chorzio. Our waiter recommended some great Spanish wines that went well with our meal. They paced everything perfectly so that you had time to eat before the next round of plates began. We cant wait to go back. Casa Mono nailed it!"
alexandras,"Dined on July 13, 2010",5,"perfect as always, esp the array of Spanish wines and a skirt steak. have been there many times and never get tired or less than impressed with each details."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 9, 2010",5,The food was amazing. We went at lunch so it was quiet but the space is small and very tightly packed--I can imagine that it is much louder when it is busier. Next time I would try to sit at the bar and watch them prepare the food. We were very happy with the experience. My daughter had the pork belly and it was one of the best dishes I have ever tasted.
boulezl,"Dined on July 9, 2010",3,Generous portions for wine; exciting dishes; well-executed. Definitely not a place for quiet conversations.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 4, 2010",3,"We were excited for our first time here. Tight seating arrangments, cozy, and you can catch neighboring conversations here and there. There was one 'order taker' and a group of servers. The order taker did not exude a warm welcoming demeanor. When she was taking our order, she had to correct one of my guests to say you have to order all at one time, in kind of crisp townhall delivery. Well, we said, give us some more time and we will adhere to your system. Sounded like a stressed work environment than the start of a nice sunday brunch, and with my out of town guest from midwest, concluding, yes it is in fact stressful in NYC. The food and attentive servers (changing plates, serving the dishes) redeemed the rest."
Foodie,"Dined on July 4, 2010",5,Excellent is all I can say. A memorable evening.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 28, 2010",4,The food was utterly amazing. The calamari was wonderful and the chorizo was the best I've had. The green beans were just better than I've ever tasted. My new favorite place! Everything was truly delicious and made for a fun meal. The service was so-so.
BigMo,"Dined on June 28, 2010",5,"outstanding. At 10 pm on a Sunday night in the summer, Casa Mono was packed with a lively crowd. Even though the space is small, we did not feel cramped at all, and the service was timely -- neither rushed nor too slow."
MetshaR,"Dined on June 23, 2010",5,"Ive eaten her before and enjoyed the food. I had the Fideos and for the first time, the soft shell crab, it was amazing. I went in with 3 friends who were eating at Casa Mono for the first time and they loved the food. Our server, Fernando, was great extremely patient and helpful. Its a very intimate place with a laid back ambiance. Will be returning!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 19, 2010",5,"Awesome tapas... pricey, but overall worth the cost. The selection, both hot an cold, was superb and flavorful, and they do have some less expensive wines, by the glass and the bottle, if you don't want to break the bank completely! Best to go with several people and taste the assortment. We went for lunch and they did not rush the experience."
nycubanpete,"Dined on June 17, 2010",5,A wonderful experience - I felt like I was having lunch on the some back street in Madrid - an absolute gem! The razor clams are worth the price of admission! :)
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 17, 2010",5,"While all Batali's restaurants seem to feature unsmiling, unpleasant hostesses, the rest of the experience was great."
LadyBoddington,"Dined on June 14, 2010",3,"Although we enjoyed the meal, the service was poor from the word go. We arrived right at noon which was the time of our reservation but found the door locked and could see employees inside still setting up. They could see us waiting on the street, yet didn't let us in until almost 10 past noon and then didn't apologize. From there things got worse as the waiters were only interested in a larger party that was drinking lots of wine. We had to ask for spoons, bread, more water, etc. All in all, we wouldn't go back due to the poor quality of service."
Mlacc,"Dined on June 13, 2010",4,This quaint little restaurant served melt in your mouth grilled polpo and razor clams. The soft shelled crab was meaty and tender with tremendous flavor. The original server was knowledgeable and friendly as his relief was cold and impersonable. I would highly recommend this intimate place for brunch/lunch at any given time.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 10, 2010",3,"I really liked their wine selection, and 2/4 dishes were great but a bit small (even for a tapas place). Also, I really wanted to like their bone marrow dish but it was just overly salted plus with the strong taste of capers, it was just too much salt. Highly recommend their octopus special."
PeterH,"Dined on June 6, 2010",5,"MB never fails to amaze us. The seared scallop, red snapper, and bone marrow tapas we had were spectacular. Tight space, but vibrant crowd."
SusanO,"Dined on June 5, 2010",2,food pretty good. service slow and waiter a snob.
PeterR,"Dined on June 2, 2010",3,our experience at Casa Mono was undoubtedly a good one. the food was outstanding but very pricey. we were a party of three and were sat at a very small table that would have been fine for 2 but it proved a little problematic with all the small plates. the host and most of the servers were very nice and helpful but our main waitress seemed a little impatient and not as helpful as she might have been in helping us understand the menu better. the wine was superb but again very expensive. all in all a wonderful place if you don't mind dropping a big bundle on tapas delights.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 1, 2010",4,"razor clams and sweet potato goat cheese croquetas were standouts but everything was beautifully cooked, ordered 8 dishes for a table of 4 and we were all pleasantly full. highly recommended for a fun and very delicious group outing, although as others have noted seating can be cramped."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 30, 2010",5,Loved the food which provides a person willing to experiment with several extremely good options.
FGS1201,"Dined on May 30, 2010",5,Always fantastic and very creative. The red snapper 'tartare' was sublime; just about everything else was delicious.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 29, 2010",4,"Having lived in Spain several years ago, Casa Mono felt like I was there all over again. From the tables and tiles, to the delightful food, it was a great overall experience, and quite authentic!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 26, 2010",4,"I ate at Casa Mono a couple of nights ago. Overall everything was great. My only small complaint was the skirt steak with onion mermelada. I think the problem had more to do with how it was sliced than anything. It just seemed a little chewy despite being cooked nicely. The star of the night was the sweetbreads. The other standouts were the Pulpo with fennel and grapefruit, red snapper crudo, mussels with chorizo,and the pork croquettas. I ate at Amada in Philly a few nights before, though it was good Casa Mono blew it out of the water."
UnwantedGuest,"Dined on May 21, 2010",4,"great super inventive dishes, very well executed; bass/cod cheek pil pil was exceptional!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 18, 2010",4,Only my second visit to this restaurant. I was thrilled with the variety of tapas and enjoyed every selection.
Mark,"Dined on May 17, 2010",5,Great food in a very cozy atmosphere
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 15, 2010",3,"Casa Mono was a good choice for out of town guests who are familiar with Mario Batali. However, I think his other restaurants are more representative of why he's so popular. The food here ranges from average (pork croquette) to great (razor clams). While the portions are appropriate and fun to share, I thought the pacing was off considerably. No one should be in a hurry when having tapas for lunch and we certainly took everything at a leisurely pace, but we were waiting up to 15 minutes between finishing one dish and being ready for the next round to arrive, so it felt long."
salvadorm,"Dined on May 11, 2010",4,"Outstanding! A little bit noisy but it dosen't matter at all because it was great food, wine and service. Thanks a lot. Salvador."
BS222,"Dined on May 9, 2010",5,"Best tapas we've found in the city. One thing to note, this restaurant is very small, which explains why it books quickly. We went on a warm day and the restaurant had the doors to the sidewalk open which made the place feel a bit bigger. Razor clams and cuddlefish were fantastic, and the bone marrow was a great recommendation from the server (something we probably wouldn't have tried without a little nudge)"
jasonnunan,"Dined on May 9, 2010",4,"Stunning ingredients. Well prepared. Great, knowledgeable server. Many thanks!"
Luvfood,"Dined on May 8, 2010",4,"It was such an amazing experience. The food was so good. The restaurent is not that spacious, but nice and warm atmosphere. I highly recommend even though it was a little pricy. The portion of each dish was like an appetizer, thus it would be better to order 2 dishes per each person."
foodie,"Dined on May 3, 2010",5,"Easily the best all around meal I've had in a long time. The food was outstanding, the service even better. My wife and I went for her birthday. It was great!"
TamarN,"Dined on May 3, 2010",4,"Unique intimate neighborhood restaurant, special experience and good tapas food"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 3, 2010",4,"The food was fantastic; I recommend both the razor clams and the duck with asparagus. The seating is very tight and the tables small as are the portions-which is to be expected-I would order 2 plates each at least, 3 if you're a little hungrier/want to try more items. In my experience, nothing on the menu has disappointed. Come prepared for a lively scene with good music, especially if you're into alternative indy-rock like the Friendly Fires. It's certainly geared toward a younger crowd. Go early on a nice evening and start out at Bar Jamon next door and then over to Casa Mono for a great open-air meal."
bordeaux,"Dined on April 30, 2010",5,Casa Mono is one of the best restaurants in NYC. The food was delicious the wine was great. It was loud and full of energy that you can only get in New York. It was a warm night so we sat with the doors open . We had a wonderful time and our waiter was so helpful w/ all his recommadation.  Marianne Bulfamante
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 28, 2010",3,Food was good but was expecting something better. The bar around the corner is great.
Alex,"Dined on April 25, 2010",4,Perhaps the finest Spanish wine list I've seen this side of the Atlantic.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 22, 2010",4,"Went to Casa Mono with my 15 year old son, an up and coming foodie, and we enjoyed a nice variety of dishes. Best, by far, was the razor clam dish, although the other samplings were quite good as well, including the goat confit. Overall, expect tight seating (we went early prior to the dinner rush), but this shouldn't detract from some great tapas. We were seated next to a window and it felt like an intimate local neighborhood restaurant."
mcf524,"Dined on April 18, 2010",5,Every dish was a hit! Only wish I could have tried everything.
FLLdiner,"Dined on April 17, 2010",5,Terrific tapas. The red snapper crudo was fantastic. Had a second order for dessert.
JulieV,"Dined on April 17, 2010",4,"Another great lunch at Casa Mono. The food is always excellent, more upscale than authentic Spanish tapas (which is essentially bar food), but consistently superb. Try the artichokes with mint, the bacalao croquetas, the deep fried peppers (seasonal, not available yet unfortunately). The wines by the glass are very good as was the manzanilla we started with.  Always a pleasure, if you haven't been here yet, you really should. Make sure you book though, it's tiny and always crowded."
KatieB,"Dined on April 17, 2010",2,"The restaurant is small, which is okay except we were in a table that was on top of another one and we might as well have dined with the people sitting next to us. You have to pull out the table to fit into the back seat which is not good. The food was good, overpriced, but good. The waiter was friendly but didn't seem to have much knowledge of the menu or wine, he had to step away and ask others about the wines before giving a suggestion. The wine menu is in spanish which presents a challenge for those who don't speak it, a simple Tinto (red) would have helped not only us but the couple sitting next to us who were as confused as we were."
dessert20,"Dined on April 11, 2010",4,Excellent food. Great lively feel and accomodating wait staff. The restaurant is small and tables close together but the staff do a great job of making it all work.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 11, 2010",4,"This was my husband's birthday and we only managed a 3pm reservation on Saturday. After reading some reviews I was a bit worried about service being not up to par, because it can ruin the whole experience no matter how good the food is. BUT IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE PLEASURE!!! Our server was a charming, knowlageble, intelegent and warm young man. Can't wish for anything more. He was all there when we needed him and not there when we didn't. Thank you very much! I dined in Casa Mono before and it can be tight for space and a bit noisey, but it's the nature of the beast. So if between hours works for you try it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 2, 2010",5,We had a fantastic experience at Casa Mono. We asked the waiter to bring a glass of whatever white wine he thought was best and it was delicious. We did the same for the tapas and he brought plate after plate of delicious and beautifully-prepared food. What a great find!
KatH,"Dined on March 31, 2010",3,The food was delicious and definitely the best part of the meal.  Our first server was excellent and then someone else took over who had a little bit of an attitude.  The tables are too close together and we were sat right by the service station (note to managers - we can hear everything the servers say and it's not always good).
ParkerK,"Dined on March 20, 2010",3,"Given all the hype surrounding this place, I was a bit disappointed. I enjoyed the atmosphere, although it is extremely small. We were at a two top and were almost right on top of the table next to us. It didn't bother me too much but some people might feel a bit cramped. The outside doors were open and it had a very nice neighborhood feel to it.  As far as the food goes, I was a bit unimpressed. The Jamon Iberico took me back to my days living in Spain, but was a bit overpriced for what you were getting, and was not the best Jamon I have tasted. The Lamb was well seasoned and cooked well, while the pork and tomato croquetas were overcooked and need a little work. All in all, I was left wanting and expected more. Great wine list though."
MamikoS,"Dined on March 3, 2010",4,"I usually go there for dinner, but tried lunch since I had a day off. Food were wonderful as always and the restaurant was not as crowded as dinner time. My friends and I could relaxed and enjoyed a weekday afternoon. I felt wine was a little pricey for the ambiance."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 25, 2010",4,A top choice for Spanish food in NYC. One of the great Spanish wine lists in the US. It's fairly small so lunch is more relaxed than the usually packed and noisier dinner scene.
Bourbonman,"Dined on February 22, 2010",2,The food was very good but the experience was ruined by the manager wh could not find a way to accomodate a table of 3 in a nearly empty restaurant well after lunch-hour. That lack of service attitude is the kiss of death of any restaurant.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 20, 2010",5,"One of my all time favorite restaurants, never failed me once when it comes to food. Cramp space with open kitchen so prepare to smell a little smokey after you're done eating."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 13, 2010",2,Everything was too salty and very tight seating
Wilse,"Dined on February 1, 2010",3,"There were only two tables occupied during our visit. The wait staff was preoccupied with stocking shelves and taking care of other business. We had to constantly ask for service. The waiter was annoyed that we did not want to order our entire meal at one time, stating that the ""kitchen"" would not be able to accomodate us properly if we did not order all together (remember, there were only two tables occupied). The food was exceptional, but clearly the wait staff forgot who was buying and who was selling. I used to consider the staff at Casa Mono to be exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful, but this experience was disappointing. I will have to seriously consider whether to return or recommend it to another."
ebenc,"Dined on January 22, 2010",5,Excellent all around. Great recommendations from the sommelier. Should have lingered longer.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 16, 2010",4,"The food is creative, delicious, and beautifully served. Very noisy and the music seems out of place with a Spanish cuisine. Our waiter, William, was stand-offish, disinterested, unhelpful, and humorless. Despite that, we would recommend for the food and the hope that you were served by a better, more engaged and fun waiter. Some highlights--pumpkin and goat cheese croquettes, sea scallops on pureed parsnips, grilled beets with salted granola, pork belly, sweetbreads, skirt steak, dorada. What is also nice is that you can order dishes to share or you can make your own meal by ordering 2 or 3 dishes. Desserts also outstanding."
LisaT,"Dined on January 6, 2010",3,"grood food, music is too loud for such a tiny place. Pricing is also too high for this venue especially considering the size of the plates."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 3, 2010",3,"I was excited about dining at Casa Mono having eaten at both Bar Pinotxo and Cal Pep. I read Mr. Batali stating that ""we basically ripped them off completely"", so I thought the food at Casa Mono (especially considering the prices) was going to be a slightly more upscale version. But everything I ordered had more or less the same basic taste to it, which was a very overpowering acidity and excess heat/spice. This was case with all 5-6 dishes, which were made of entirely different ingredients. The lack of table space did not bother me, I found it cozy and intimate (European). The service was good, but the food itself is just NOT very Spanish. The food from the kitchen did not meet my expectations. Next time I'll just order jamon and manchego."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 2, 2010",2,"Don't expect to be treated well when you're here. The food is good, but I've had better tapas elsewhere, without the accompanying attitude. The tables are crowded too close together for diners to feel comfortable. The service was lackluster and the reception at the hostess desk seemed to reflect a belief that diners should consider themselves fortunate to have the chance to eat here."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 31, 2009",4,Great food but very tight seating
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 30, 2009",4,"This tucked away newcomer is a beauty at night with its warm glow and greenhouse appearance. It is quite small and popular now so plan time slots accordingly because it gets cramped. Many dishes were delicious, but a preponderance of them are too ""extreme"" in their tastes or ingredients and more ""mainstream"" candidates are needed, and a bit less salt would be wise. The fideos with clams was superb. The wine list is impressive, as was the tab (almost $500 for 5 with one bottle of wine and just a few drinks)."
tishj,"Dined on December 26, 2009",5,"I love this restaurant -- the food is memorabe which is high praise from me! Despite the wonderful pedigree, I feel right at home here."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 24, 2009",5,"Casa Mono is always consistent, the food is authentic and creative, service is friendly and yet really professional. We have never be disappointed."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 21, 2009",3,"My expectations were high because I live in Atl & assumed that NYC would have better tapas. While Casa Mono was good, it was not as good as I had expected. The restaurant was tiny...claustrophobics beware. The wine list was huge...wines from every region in Spain. We ordered the Pumpkin croquetas w/goat cheese(interesting), Calamares Fritos (good),Piquillo Peppers w/Oxtail (excellent) and Veal cheek Tagine w/sweet potato cous cous (excellent). We were about to skip dessert but thankfully decided to order Crema Catalana con bunuelos...it was the highlight of the meal...closely resembling creme brulee but with a darker caramel crust. It was accompanied with batter fried bay leaves...the dessert made the meal."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 16, 2009",2,"A friend and I had lunch at Casa Mono in mid December and thought it was okay, but not great. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, but 3 out of the 4 things were pretty average. This place is VERY small and only 4 tables were filled. Service was decent, but the waiter's attitude was not."
RMB2024,"Dined on December 2, 2009",3,"The food was fine (missteps: gritty clams, undercooked artichoke, overcooked patatas). The service could have been better: it took a good minute or two for anyone to greet me when I arrived, which seemed rather inexcusable given that the restaurant was otherwise empty. Also, because the restaurant was empty, it seemed unnecessary to ask me to step next door (the better to purchase more wine?) until the rest of my party (a single person) arrived. The meal itself was conducted on a fairly leisurely scale- -which in general I appreciate, though it seems excessive to have to wait 10 minutes on an empty house, and at the counter, for a server to inquire after a drink order. Also: server needs to know that artichokes aren't brussel sprouts"
HGWT,"Dined on November 30, 2009",3,The small plates here are very good but the space is just too cramped to enjoy the food.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 28, 2009",5,"not only is the food delicious, but much of the menu has uncommon items for NYC, so that already makes the restaurant an exception."
LJReviewer,"Dined on November 27, 2009",4,Very small but great food. Only comment would be to have additional plates available so that the various tastes from each tapas selection are not mixed. We had 4 individual items that we shared but were only given one plate each.
JuneS,"Dined on November 7, 2009",3,"Food was good but not as great as I expected based on other people's reviews. Everything that I ordered was a bit too salty. However, the pumpkin croquettes were amazing. Overall, there are better tapas, which were priced more reasonably."
SFaphile,"Dined on November 7, 2009",2,"It was the lowest Michelin rated restaurant we visited, so it wss interesting to see what passes for 1-star in NYC, and the answer is not much. The food was fair and I imagine there are better tapas bars in the city. The wine list was reasonably priced. The room is too small for a nice evening and we felt rushed to finish our meal so they could turn the table over to the next group."
MichelinStarHunter,"Dined on November 2, 2009",4,"One of my favorites: food is amazing, top ingrediants and so tasty. Tiny and crowded, but this is what makes it romantic. If you want to taste what real tapas tastes like, go here!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 2, 2009",4,"This is my fourth time at Casa Mono, and I still recommend it to my friends. It's also a good date place.  With so many choices on the menu, it's fun to experiment (and hard to go wrong). Some of the highlights are the bacalao fritters, the lamb ribs, and the pumpkin & goat cheese croquetas. Leave the tripe for Mario..."
