      "Processing review: We had a great experience. Alex, our server was so gracious, humorous and accommodating. Ask to sit in Alex’s section!\n",
      "Processing review: The service was terrible. The steak was just okay and the lobster was not good at all. Food came out warm but not hot. I thought the food was not worth what we paid.  Probably will not revisit.\n",
      "Processing review: An excellent meal The fliet mignon and lobster was fantastic The side portions was plenty for 2 people Wine was a bit expensive than the normal\n",
      "Processing review: We had a ball! Perfect from start to finish! It was my 59th birthday!\n",
      "Error processing review: Extra data: line 6 column 1 (char 57)\n",
      "Processing review: Food was amazing, my second time there will be back again and again\n",
      "Processing review: Third time here & third time I’ve left completely satisfied. From the food to the vibe to the service, everything was top tier, as I’ve come to expect. I’ll definitely continue my patronage of this establishment in both locations.\n",
      "Processing review: Fun music and good food. The initial seating was problematic but once we were relocated, our experience improved.\n",
      "Processing review: Alex was the best waiter ,suggested The Duck and it was outstanding\n",
      "Processing review: Incredible Service. Food was hot and full of flavor. 10/10\n",
      "Processing review: My wife and I been going to BCH for many years now. The food and the service is always on point!!! Michael our server was great and took the time to explain everything!!! He kept checking in on us to ensure we had everything we need and had a pleasant personality while serving us. We are definitely going back again!!!\n",
      "Processing review: Great Food. Service to cost was not there. But staff was very nice and kind. Would go back for sure.\n",
