      "Processing review: Brooklyn Chophouse Review  I recently dined at Brooklyn Chophouse, and while the service and ambiance were on point, the food itself left much to be desired. The staff was attentive and friendly, making the experience smooth from start to finish. The restaurant’s vibe was modern and upscale, with a comfortable atmosphere that’s perfect for a night out.  Unfortunately, the food didn’t quite live up to the expectations set by the atmosphere or the price. The dishes were just okay—not bad, but certainly not worth the premium price tag. For a place that positions itself as a high-end dining experience, the flavors and quality fell flat. While I appreciated the overall experience, I would have expected a higher level of culinary excellence given the cost.  In summary: great service, nice ambiance, but the food was underwhelming and overpriced.\n",

It was a regular dinner to catch up with a friend until I remembered her birthday was the following week. The server was so nice and gracious. He had a suave Eastern European accent. And took care of us well. We had the kung pao,  shrimp fried rice, steamed edamame dumplings and three deserts bc we couldn’t choose one. The service here is top notch including the lady with long dark hair who tended to me at the bar, the host up front and doorman. I even got a take out order made to take for family. Will def return to try more menu options.\n",

      "Processing review: In my opinion, this place is way overrated for what you receive and for the quality and taste of food you received. I ordered the dry aged tomahawk steak. The meat was chewy, fatty  and unseasoned. Seemed like they just threw salt and pepper on the steak, which I can do at home and put it on my grill and get the same taste without the $159 bill. The mashed potatoes were good and so were the onion rings. We were told by the waiter that we had to order all courses up front which I found ridiculous. They don't give you bread or anything to nibble on while you're waiting for your food. To seat four people they actually take two small tables and put them together leaving a space in the middle in which my drink fell over once the waiter put it on the table. The drink was replaced but you would think for these prices they would have two people and four people tables. Anyway, needless to say I will not be going back to this establishment. I am a foodie and taste is everything to me and for the $410.00 that I spend for 2 people, which I don't mind but this place was no thrill at all.\n",

We had to request to put in our order for drinks and food. Everything took an exceptionally long time to make it’s way to the table, while we understand food - there was no reason we had to wait longer than 20 min for a drink when the bar was empty and the restaurant was not busy.

      "Processing review: I recently dined at Brooklyn chophouse, enticed by its promising reputation and inviting ambiance. However, my experience was a mixed bag, leaving me with conflicting impressions.  Upon entering, I was greeted warmly by the staff, setting a positive tone for the evening. The atmosphere was charming, with cozy lighting and tasteful decor, creating an inviting ambiance for a relaxed dining experience.  However, my expectations took a slight dip when the food arrived. While the dishes were decent, they fell short of the culinary excellence I had anticipated. The flavors were satisfactory, but lacked the depth and innovation I had hoped for. Each bite left me craving a bit more excitement and creativity on the plate.  On the bright side, the service was good throughout the meal. The staff was attentive and courteous, ensuring that our needs were met with efficiency and a genuine smile. Their hospitality certainly added a layer of enjoyment to the overall experience.  In summary, Brooklyn chophouse offers a pleasant environment and commendable service, but falls short of delivering the exceptional culinary experience I had anticipated. While the food was satisfactory, it lacked the wow factor that would elevate it to a memorable dining experience.\n",

Midweek, place basically empty, early dining time so there would be no imminent rush.  Told by wait staff we had to order apps and mains at the same time.  Never heard of such, especially during a non volume time.  So…  We only ordered apps and drinks and left.  Had we had entrees too according to our initial plan,  they would have made more money and I would be complimenting steaks perhaps.  The prices for steaks seemed high, but apps were great.\n",

They came to the bar hastily and said please close out your tab so you can be seated . The tan was closed however we did not get seated until 9:55 pm . We were pressed for time as we had a show to catch . When we tried to get some kind of clarification they were so short dismissive and rude . 3 other tables were seated before us . On top of there were multiple tables empty. It was just such a bad first experience . However the food was very good . Along with our waiter . But based off that i would not step foot back in that restaurant. The way we were dismissed was just insane\n",

Service was good, but a place with prices like this, you should have printed menus and leftovers should be boxed for you.  Scanning a QR code for an $89 steak just doesn't make sense.  And dropping a bunch of boxes on our table to box up our own food is not representative of fine dining.\n",

      "Processing review: My partner and I went for restaurant week this year. The place had a lovely ambience with a classic downtown Manhattan feel. Low lighting, quiet music in the background and a feel of a great night out. However, the food quantity we received and for the value was not up to par. The filet minon beef and broccoli should just be called beef and broccoli. Growing up in New York my whole life, I would much rather order from any random Chinese restaurant. The bacon cheeseburger dumplings were not to my personal liking, but the bok choy side was delicious. Overall with drinks and tip, the bill came out to $180 during restaurant week, meaning this would’ve been a $250 plus dinner on a normal night, and for that price, I would not recommend this place at all.\n",

      "Processing review: I arrived at my reservation time and was immediately sat down and showed where to locate the menu using the QR code. However, everything from there was horrible. I had been sat 15 mins and my waiter had not showed up to introduce themselves and see what I needed. After 15 mins, I flagged the waiter walking past me and after stating that I had been waiting for someone to come so I can order / be acknowledged, he responded “I guess I can serve you”. Before he walked away I placed my drink order, and it arrived after 5 mins, but I didn’t see my waiter again. I eventually had to ask another person to find my waiter so I could order food.  This is super disappointing because this was my first experience at this restaurant and it’s unlikely that I will return. I showed up as a party of one, and that was probably my mistake. The other tables with larger parties and couples together had no issue being served. I dine out often alone and did not feel seen or that my experience was just as important as the others from this experience. The waiter was not warm and I had to seek him to get anything. What makes this experience even worse is that I was right in front of the restaurant, near where the waiters based by frequently for materials, so I would have expected for the service to be quicker.  Additionally, my food came out fairly quick. I ordered the shrimp friend rice, chicken wontons & spring roll with two drinks. The rice and wontons were good but the spring rolls taste as if they were fried in old grease and the drinks were not strong. I didn’t bring any of this up to my waiter because I was ready to go and just wanted to pay to leave. This experience ruined my entire night and I decided to call it a night early.\n",

      "Processing review: It’s on the louder end because people are enjoying themselves and having a great time and vibing. Let them. I ordered the spicy watermelon margarita - delicious - and the porterhouse Pittsburgh style and it was perfectly charred and salted with a medium to medium rare center. The steaks are more expensive here than I’m used to at traditional steakhouses so we did not get a side.\n",

      "Processing review: This was my first time at Brooklyn Chop House.  The food is a unique blend of steakhouse with Asian fusion.  Be advised that the portions are quite large and intended to be shared.  This is true for appetizers, entrees and sides.  The appetizers were great...the crab soup dumplings, french onion soup dumplings, and reuben dumplings were unexpected and interesting combinations of ingredients and absolutely tasty.  The scallion pancakes (and the dipping sauce) were unexpectedly delicious for such a simple dish. The steaks were well cooked and properly seasoned. We had the surf and turf; the garlic lobster tails were fantastic and the filet was so tender. The sides were also very tasty.  We ordered the mushrooms, the broccoli, and the mashed potatoes.  An overall great experience with attentive and personable staff from the time we walked in through our departure.  Definitely a treat, but prepare yourself for the cost.\n",

The Lychee martini was good and not common which was unique.  Drinks were okay but not up to the price being charged.  The chicken sauté was ok.and nothing to brag about.  I would recommend ordering something else. Steak and lobster were very very good!  They nailed the seasoning on the steak and medium rare was actually medium rare which was on spot. I would not recommend the lobster with the ginger sauce but it wasn’t bad.  I just could have used something additional In the flavor department. Garlic ginger mashed potatoes were pretty good.  Order the steak.  And the service was awesome!  Environment was good and people were friendly.\n",

A \"Chop\" house with a asian flair might of been better (food was pretty good) but they make you order everything all at once (so you over order) and then after the appitziers they brought the soup, salads and dinner all at the same time (weird).  Very obvious the server and likley her management has never been to a fine \"Chop\" house before.  Also, only about 30% full which is weird in NYC on a Wednesday night.  And, the wine list is very small for a \"Chop\" house and the years of the wine listed they did not have for the two bottles we ordered.\n",

Not unusual for a Friday night in NYC, but the reason stated was new, the waiters are only allowed to place one food order per table.  We were about to leave to go to a local bar to get a predinner drink when the hostess seated us.  We were told by the waiter that we need to order all food at once.  We did as we were told ordering several very unique dumpling appetizers and steaks.  I specifically requested the appetizers come out first, I was told that would not be an issue.  About 20 minutes later our steaks came out without appetizer.   Our waiter was upset and was in the process of taking them back to await our appetizers.  Not wanting cold or over cook steaks, we decided to skip the appetizers.  Again, the steaks and sides were excellent, but if you are looking for a muti course dinner, maybe look elsewhere.\n",

My party had some reservation issues and wanted to sit next to another party. The manager was very understanding and accommodating. Throughout the night she continued to check on both parties ensuring we were pleased with the service. I’ve been to Brooklyn Chop House 3 times prior and I’ve never had a manager so engaged with the business.  She was very down to earth, she cracked a few jokes with us and made sure we had a great time. As managers and supervisors ourselves, the entire party appreciated the great customer service. Other than that the food and service from the staff is always a 10 out of 10. Very pricey but you get what you pay for. The waiter was able to make good recommendations for my friend based on her personal taste & she loved the suggestion. Overall, great experience. Thank You !\n",

      "Processing review: This Restaurant has been on my radar for sometime now. I decided to have a small birthday dinner at the lower Manhattan location. The food was everything, crab fried rice and bok choy was my favorites. Overall the food and drinks were really good. The service was ok,  the clearing of the table and the staring from the wait staff was uncomfortable. My party was a little annoyed by that. We wanted to chat view the menu before deciding on our order,  however we felt rushed. At one point we had to tell him, WE NEED MORE TIME.  Once the food arrived, as we are eating, the staff kept hovering over our table a bit. Overall we did enjoy ourselves, the surprise slice of cheesecake with the sparkler was a great birthday treat. I would recommend and return.\n",

Sitting down thought it was a little tight and didn't like sitting in the middle if room with so many walking past but did like the mood that was set with the dim lighting and music playing. Service was horrible. Water came immediately but kept forgetting to bring things we ask for such as a straw. Tipped min standard but regretted it because he didn't deserve it but the bust boy was helpful. Food was was not worth the money. Order the steak and lobster for 2. Steak over cooked as well as the lobster and both very blan. Also got sweet and sour chicken and asked for it without the sauce. Showed up to the table covered in sauce and he says he forgot. When getting my order they were very chewy and some hard. Overall would say it was a waste of money and time going to the city. Luckily NY is a cool spot and strolled around the city to make the trip with it. Would not be going again\n",

Subpar: Philly Dumplings, Pac-Man dumplings could have been warmer.  Note:  The waiter should let you know that the 20% tip is included in your overall bill and anything else is an additional tip, however we did not receive that communication and almost assumed another 18%-20% should be added to our already $720 bill.

Ended up ordering sparking water twice because the initial waiter did not cater to our request on time. Ordered the penthouse steak and it was the worst steak I had ever tried. No flavor whatsoever, will be jaded from this experience and probably never try the penthouse ever again, but overall would never visit again, there’s better steakhouses that would accommodate to better service.\n",

The waiting area, we basically was standing on top of people as every that had a reservation was pushed back. The hostess in the front had an attitude. I get it holidays are overwhelming but they should have patience like they expect us to have. Sitting down finally, the waiter came about 10-15 minutes later just to introduce himself and then came back 10-15 minutes to take our drinks. Upon returning with the drinks, he took our order. I’ve been here multiple times and the mash usually comes on the tin to share. Today it came in a bowl that was for person. When asked he seemed bothered and said they don’t serve it like that anymore. That is something that should had been discussed from jump. When the bill came, I was charged differently from what the menu showed. He quickly fixed that. I rarely look at the bill but I’m glad I did.

Anyway, my feelings are even more solidified and judging by Instagram and TikTok followers they agree with my original review, which you can read below:  Waiter rushed us along. Food was not very good at all. We heard amazing things, which is why we chose it but, we won’t return. We were supposed to come back with my sister and her husband but I told them not to bother.\n",

      "Processing review: Me and my little sis had been looking forward to dining at the Brooklyn chop house for months. I booked a reservation months in advance to celebrate our February birthdays. I requested a half booth in the reservation “special request “ section. Our reservation was at 6pm we arrived at 5pm. We were willing to wait to be seated because we were a hour early. One of the hostess decides to seat us early. She puts me and my sis at a small table between two couples. Immediately I request a half booth because it was a cramped space and even my sis who is slender was extremely uncomfortable. The hostess insists that because it’s only two of us we cannot get a half booth. She informs us that we can wait for the same size table to become available in a different area. She tells us to wait at the bar. At this point I’m ready to leave and write a scathing review on yelp , the bartender asks us if we would like to speak to the manager. The gracious manager not only seats us promptly but we have one of the best tables in the house. We were sat at a long booth with two tables push together to make one table. The ill mannered hostess kept staring at us but we ignored her and had an amazing meal. We also noticed that the hostess just wanted to be difficult with us for whatever reason because later two couples were seated near us both in half booths. So she lied about the reason why we couldn’t have one in the first place smh anyways. Our waiter was awesome she gave us top recommendations on what to order. Everything was delicious but the star of the meal was definitely the ginger mashed potatoes which I ordered with sweet and sour chicken. The ginger beef noodles and the short rib bao buns were a close second in rank. They gave us each a slice of red velvet cake to wish us a happy birthday I’m not a red velvet fan but the cake was tasty as well. The place is expensive but you’re paying for an experience so it’s to be expected. I recommend going beware of the weird hostess.\n",

      "Processing review: If I ever find myself in the city again, this is definitely where I'll be coming to eat; I had the NY strip (best steak I've had) along with the cheesesteak dumplings (a must order for appetizers). The service is phenomenal; from the moment I walked in with my fiancé, we were greeted and accommodated as if we were regulars.  Boukary was our waiter, and I was extremely impressed with his service. He made sure we were well taken care of. Provided suggestions on what sides pair well with the steak I ordered. Biggest plus point= without me telling him, he caught my fiancé mentioning that it was her birthday and he made sure to bring out a dessert to sing a birthday song. My fiancé was impressed that I never left the table so she did not expect this surprise, thank you Boukary and staff; I'll be coming back again with my family and friends for sure!\n",

The hostess came off unpleasant & sour upon greeting in the establishment. When coming to eat at any restaurant a customer wants to feel welcomed upon entering, that was the only issue. The lambchops were filling & the Red Velvet frozen drink was amazing. The waiter for my section was extremely welcoming & very gracious, she had suggestions & made sure to follow up with making sure our experience wasn’t a complete waste, she really made the evening. The dessert cake was the sealed stamp to come back which is always appreciated. Hostess don’t need to be fired however more properly trained to deal with guests especially when most people are ordering online & don’t want to dine out as much.\n",

I ordered the Colorado Lamb Chops , Crab Fried Rice, Onion Rings, French fries and a few drinks. I couldn’t tell which was more bland the Lamb Chops or the Crab fried rice. There was no flavor whatsoever. The Crab Fried Rice still had what seemed to be crab shells, the onion rings were soft and the French fries were just awful. The best thing I had was the Tropical Punch. Honestly, this restaurant is not worth a quarter of the hype it gets. I urge you to try something that is worth your hard earned money.\n",

The restaurant was not very busy and we would look over and see her just standing there multiple times. She almost never checked in with us and when she did it felt like she was still annoyed to be there. At one point, she spilled almost half of my drink on the table and myself when putting it down. I understand that things happen, however on top of everything else it was frustrating. At the end of the meal it took forever to just get the check. We left a tip, however I almost wish I had not since due to the delay we missed our train and had to either wait an hour and a half for the next one or pay for a $50 Uber.

It was a birthday which they failed to even communicate to the waitress. By the time we finished eating - the service and food were so disappointing we didn’t even mention it.  1. Waitress was rude and had to be flagged over by the manager to take our second drink order 15-20 mins after our first drink was finished. The manager who was at the bar talking to friends for the entire duration of our dining experience.  2.  The food was sub par - the lobster was soggy and overcooked and the waitress had trouble describing how it was prepared and rolled her eyes when we asked for clarification. For a $200 entre the waitstaff should know how to describe it.  3. Bathrooms were a mess. Hostess was in there on her phone taking up the only free stall.  If you’re looking to celebrate a birthday or special occasion do it somewhere else. Plenty of other nice steakhouses in New York that will accommodate you with good food and great service.

      "Processing review: It was our first time at Brooklyn Chop House (downtown), We celebrated my Husband birthday . The food was delicious! The drinks was very good especially the tropical punch frozen , I even ordered two of them. The only thing was the waiting time. Our reservation was for 8:30pm we arrived at 8:20 pm and we understand we was early , so we had to sit at the bar until a table was available for us. We waited until 8:45 and the host called us to the table where was being seated, as we get to the table we had to wait again because the party had just left and the table wasn’t cleaned yet. So we had to sit again at a table that was ready  and cleaned , while our table was being cleaned (if that make sense). Also i booked my reservation online and informing it was a birthday for the occasion and our waiter didn’t sing happy birthday or brought a slice of cake. I don’t kno if i was supposed to let the waiter know , but I thought the reason for asking online while booking an reservation was to give a heads up.Otherwise the atmosphere was beautiful , food was GRADE A EXCELLENT! Would definitely go back.  Janell\n",

The dumpling was very good. My partner advised it was the best steak he's had and he's such a meat/steak guy so that coming from him is a wow factor. The broccoli was also very good, nice and firm with an great garlic flavor so yummy. The ribeye was a bit on the pricey side, the most we ever spent on steak ($110 for 24 oz bone in ribeye) and I wished the hot fudge sundae was with chocolate hot fudge instead of caramel. Nonetheless, everything was delicious.\n",

Steak prices are higher than all the real steakhouses (ie the ones that don’t double as an overpriced Chinese restaurant), but the quality of food and service falls far short of that of a real steakhouse.   The waiter was nice enough, but when my female friend got his attention and asked for a glass of wine or dessert, he took her order and was in his way without even asking me whether I wanted anything to drink or for dessert.  It was a little bizarre.   Bottom line is that it is not close to being in the same class as a real steakhouse and it should be much cheaper until it earns its stripes.\n",

Then after we picked the chicken and lobster salad (which are huge, no complaints) told us we needed to pick something else because the department of health had been watching the restaurant.. weird. There was a busboy who was watching our table like a hawk. And would rush over to get our plates before we could properly finish our meal. It made her feel uncomfortable so we left without getting dessert. Now she doesn’t want to return. Please speak with them because I love to support black owned businesses.

However, I understand everything when up price wise and demands are higher; but if you gonna charge $35 for lobster fried rice and $32 for lobster wonton at least make sure I can taste the damn lobster. don’t get me wrong, the flavor was there in every bite, delicious but too overpriced when you not getting what you are paying for.\n",

Because they close at 11 they had to bring everything out at once which wasn’t an issue for me. The music was good. However, so far 3 people out of 7 became sick from the food, which is why I decided to give 3 stars instead of 5.\n",

We had to ask for another glass of wine twice as they forgot.  We ordered ice cream for dessert, and then they came back later to tell us they don't have ice cream that night either, so we waiting for nothing again.

      "Processing review: This relatively new establishment is on its way to being a very excellent place to dine in the downtown area. But as of today the food is barely adequate when compared to the level that the restaurant is catering. The problem is that the food is mediocre. I had some basic dishes that sounded rather interesting, like the cheeseburger and pastrami dumplings, avoid them. The  wonton soup was OK but nothing special. The chicken lettuce wrap, standard in many places, was mediocre, even PF Chang beats it big-time. We had many main dishes, like the short rib, the fish, and the steak. All are a mistake, when compared to what this place is supposed to deliver. . . But I do feel long-term that they will get it right and be a far more tasty as well as elegant restaurant in the Lower Downtown area.\n",

Second of all the service is top tier. Shout out to the staff. Shout out to Angel. They make you feel like you are spending millions with them. They literally wait on you you don’t have to ask they catch your vibe and they rock with you. I love it here and they were short staffed and still made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant and they never skipped a beat. TOP TIER!!! The drinks are strong but you don’t know it until you finish it and you leaning. The food was so good we didn’t eat it all because when I say somebody Black auntie with the seasoning is in the back chef-in it up! We are Haitian and we love seasoned food and even my Haitian mother was going off. This food is ABSOLUTELY amazing and fresh. IYKYK The flavor combos and the dish inspirations. Muah *Chef’s kiss* I ate a portion of my food purposely saving it to go home and demolish it which I did. Amazing time, amazing staff, amazing food, vibes all that.

Seemed like a place trying to be a 5 Star steakhouse that does not know how to do that.  $470 meal for Salad, Filet, mashed potatoes and a bottle of wine that would be $50 at any wine shop was $150.

There was another waitress, who had to check on our appetizers and realized our order was never put in. Food was mediocre at best. Best thing was the appetizers.

The ambiance was warm and inviting, a perfect place for any occasion. The service was great! The drinks kept flowing and it didn't take long for my food to come.   The food was so good! I'm a pescatarian so I had seafood dumplings, impossible burger dumplings, shrimp, veggie fried rice, and rich red velvet cake, all of it was delicious. My meat eater friends liked their dishes and ordered some food to go. It's pricey $$$, but they really feed you so I can't complain.   I would highly recommend this place. I'm definitely going back. I can't wait for them to open their 2nd place in Times Square in December.\n",

      "Processing review: Ordered crab soup dumplings and PASTRAMI dumplings for appetizer.  The crab dumplings was one hour away from smelling bad, but the  taste told the story.  The crab meat was spoiled and not fresh at all.  The little bits of pastrami in the pastrami dumplings was worse.  It consisted of hard gristle pieces.  For main course we ordered the surf and turf , with the crispy lobster.   We also ordered lobster fried rice.  What we got was the ginger garlic lobster and not the fried lobster.  The ginger lobster was also spoiled,  it had an underlying ammonia smell.  You could not smell it right away due to the ginger and garlic but once we got the left overs home that ammonia smell was definite .  The lobster fried rice has literally one piece of lobster.  With all of this,  I finally spoke up.  The manger was very kind and offered what she could to remedy the situation. She also offered to  change the fried rice which we accepted, only to see that the waitress charged us for two lobster fried rice.  I don’t mind paying for what I ate or ordered but , we did not get two fried rice.  This was my second visit and this visit was sub-par.\n",

      "Processing review: The service, including the hostess that seated my father and myself was good. I ordered the California lobster avocado salad, lobster “Spring Roll” dumplings, lamb chops and garlic mashed potatoes. My dad had the rib eye. I enjoyed eating the salad, lamb chops and potatoes. The dumplings, however, were horrible and had no lobster filling, which I mentioned to the waiter hoping there was an error. The waiter in response attempted to assure me and stated that there was lobster in the dumpling but it’s heavily seasoned. There was no lobster; just seasoning. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to the lobster dumplings; my dad only tried one and refused to eat anymore since we were served essentially seasoned dough. I also did not like the presentation of the mashed potatoes in a metal bucket but that’s just my opinion. Overall my experience was good with the exception of the dumplings.\n",

I would have sent the food back, but they crammed so many seats into the place that I ate the cost of it to expedite my trip.  Restaurant was not worth the cost.\n",

The lobster and steak came out luke warm, but it was seasoned pretty good.  The sides also came out warm and not hot.  The food wasn't horrible, just not hot.

      "Processing review: After I convinced my date to take an hour drive on a rainy Sunday evening, We were seated 45 later than our reservation time. Already a bad start but we figured the food would make up for that Indiscretion,  We were sat at a very tiny table which we literally had to squeeze our arms in at the table to compensate for servers and patrons. We ordered 2 appetizers each that could  barely fit on the table, which prompted me to ask for a bigger table since I saw couples that came after us that didn’t have any reservation was seated at. But by the time the moving was concluded the mushroom soup we ordered was cold along with the three other appetizers. They sat us at the table which is equal to us sitting outside, every time the door opened we were ambushed with gushing freezing air. There are no proper waiting area and apparently reservations were being handled by someone who isn’t fit to be in that department. Every one that walked through the door somehow made their way next to our table and it was no longer us eating but us and 10 other ppl that was so close next to our table that I think they could see the fruit fly that wouldn’t leave us alone.  After speaking to the young lady at the front desk (there were 3 of them, the one who wore her tiny leather skirt and her bra straps popping out, that’s the one I’m talking about) (bad attitude as well) so I went to her and explained that we are not comfortable eating with very cold air every 2 mins however she seemed more annoyed than we were and said there’s nothing she could do and as she passed by countless times I don’t know what was more disturbing, her unpleasant face as she glared at us or the fact she didn’t want to make eye contact.  A $550.00 check for 2 ppl which would’ve been more only if we were comfortable, nevertheless it wasn’t worth it!   I get that a business must utilize every square inch of their establishment but when it means having your patrons being cold and uncomfortable, is it really worth it???\n",

He was very slow, and was rude when he realized we had a 15% discount for staying at a local hotel- literally crumbled up the bill in his hand and walked away in a huff. However the rest of the staff was super friendly. Disappointed we took the recommendation from the hotel to try this place.\n",

I was veryyyy disappointed with my medium ribeye. The meat was dry and lacked flavor. I would not go back if I wanted to enjoy a steakhouse dinner.  On the other hand the asian dishes were all very good (bacon cheeseburger dumplings, rock shrimp tempura, ginger beef noodles, pork fried rice, kung pao chicken). That part of the fusion is done very well.   I hoped for more out of this Chop House\n",

      "Processing review: I had a reservation for 7 PM. We were not seated at a table until 8:03. They kept myself and my party standing outside in the rain because the very small lobby and bar area was filled to capacity. When we were permitted to go inside and check in with the hostess (who was very kind) we had to squeeze in the bar area over the tables that were eating.  The check of the vaccination cards were a joke as they didn’t ask for ID to go along with it and people just flashed quick pictures on their phones.  There was no enforcement of wearing masks while you waited for your table inside or with the employees.  The music was entirely too loud and there was a struggle to hear what the waiters/staff were saying to you. Due to the high volume the staff did not maintain social distance at all.  The tables were entirely too close together along the outer walls upstairs.  The food was… let’s just say it left a lot to be desired and my entire group left unsatisfied and wishing we had made a different choice for our annual Christmas celebration dinner.  The best thing that I had on the menu was the apple crumb cheesecake and a glass of seltzer with lemon.  Overall, I would say save your money and a trip with expensive parking to Brooklyn Chophouse.  I should also add that it was extremely annoying that their door security saved multiple street parking spots with cones. This entitlement allowed their friends to have prime parking and walk right in without showing a Vaccination Card or wait on line.\n",

First time and wanted to try a few items. $453.72 including tip for 2. Server never realized that I was going to be the guest that needed a larger table and more attentive service. Porterhouse for 2 and my wifes entree were excellent. Sides, apps and cocktails were disappointing. Needs to improve bottle service. Lots of NYC comp on the porterhouse, but would order again. Recommend only for the steak\n",

We had a very nice Thanksgiving dinner and our server started out very upbeat and exited to wait on us and mid way he seemed not so pleasant and accommodating. We were overcharged for the filet Mignon but he took so long to bring the check and check on us towards the end we jus to paid it unfortunately.  The food was delish and we made the most of the ambiance and joy of being together.  We will return - !\n",

      "Processing review: Our reservation was originally for 8 o’clock. When we arrived we had to wait online to check in for our reservation. Then the bouncers instructed us to wait until we are called on the side of the building and not block the front entrance. On the side of the building they had a heated seating area where we could wait for our table to be ready. It was very cold that night and there were a lot of people waiting to be seated. While we waited outside to be called for our reservation there were two young women outside screaming and cursing because they were put out of the restaurant. It was very intense. We waited outside for approximately 20 minutes. My goddaughter called the restaurant three times while waiting outside because of the commotion and the cold. We were seated at our table around 8:30pm even thou our reservation was for 8pm. Our waiter Kim, was very funny, nice and knowledgeable. The food was decent, drinks were decent. We went to use the restroom, there was toilet tissue in one stall. We had to pass the toilet tissue under/over the stall. The bathroom trash bin was over flowing with hand towels (please see photo). I was very disappointed in the overall experience. Our bill was $500 with gratuity.\n",

Our waiter had no idea what some of the menu items were and could not explain to us what the 7lb duck meant. I have never seen a 7lb duck served in a restaurant and I asked him if it meant that was how big the duck was prior to cooking and deboning.  He kept telling us \"no, it's a 7lb duck delivered to the table.\"  What actually came to the table was of course not a 7lb duck.    The lobster fried rice hardly had any lobster and was not at all a good value.  The pork soup dumplings had a very tough and chewy wrapper that is not typical of xiao long bao.  The pac man dumplingers were cute but lacked any seafood flavor.  Tasted like a shrimp shumai.\n",

We didn't even bother ordering. I immediately secured a reservation at Mortons. The whole experience was such a mess. Never coming back here again. You would think for such an expensive restaurant, they would have better service. This almost ruined my anniversary date night. Honestly spend your money at another steakhouse who would actually value their guests. . . Heads up! The reviews section for this restaurant is flooded with fake 4 star and 5 star reviews.

From having to wait over 30 min for a reservation that we were on time for because they were overbooked, to the unseasoned bass and steak that we had with our prefix menu. Ordered and an overpriced VSOP drink with the smoke just to be told they didn’t have the smoke. The drink was horrible. The bathroom was a hot mess. FILTHY. One stall out of order so only one available for use. One faucet did not work.  definitely was not what I expected and will not be going back.   Honestly I was happy to try them but they are definitely overpriced and not worth it could have saved my family two thousand dollars which ended being out total.

      "Processing review: I honestly heard only good things about this place. A lot of hype.  But unfortunately it wasn’t the case for us.  We had reservations at 8:30pm on a Friday.  We got there 10 min earlier ,and trust me when I say it was a good thing we got there earlier . We had to wait on line OUTSIDE (55 degrees weather) just to see the host.  After 20 min of waiting outside we FINALLY saw the host, she then advised us that there is NO open seat at the moment and we need to wait (DID I MENTIONED WE HAD A RESERVATION?! oh okay…)  We asked to wait for a table (for our reservation of 2 people) OUTSIDE AGAIN! and as advised by the host and manager “we don’t know how long this going to take but you can leave your number and we will text you)  So we did as advised and waited outside. For 25min! FINALLY - we walking to the table . And we were seated by the bar… The place was packed!! The bar was crowded with people! So crowed that for the whole dinner it felt like they were eating with us at the table !  We waited 20 min for our drinks (we had the spicy watermelon margarita- it was sour and not strong at all!)  Thank God we ordered appetizers because we waited for 45 minutes for our entrees.. oh and that’s 45 minutes after we finished the appetizers .so as you can imagine we waited A LONG time for the food.  We had the veal chop and lamb chop ! - the veal chop was too well done although we asked for medium rare, and the lamb chop was burned as we asked for medium well.  I was scared to asked to get a new lamp chop since this took over an hour to get to our table but I had too asked for a new one since I couldn’t eat burned meat!  As we are waiting for the new lamb chop we asked for drinks, that took another 20 min to arrive to the table. And when they did we realized we received the wrong drinks. Took another 15 min to get someone to pay attention to us for us to request for the correct drinks.   OVERALL, the staff was nice and music was good. We didn’t enjoy anything else.\n",

The appetizers were also tasty. We had the lamb dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps. Little did I know that at that point our experience had peaked. As for the entrees, first the good, my son's 16 oz filet mignon was exceptional. Cooked perfect and very tasty. However, my salt & pepper sea bass and my wife's crispy beef were extremely disappointing. When I order a $42 sea bass entree I not expecting it to be thinly cut, breaded and deep fried. It looked more (and tasted) like a haddock fish fry than a higher quality piece of fish. The taste was fairly bland and it needed the two dipping sauces...again this is sea bass not cod. The crispy beef came batter dipped and it had more batter than beef. TBH it looked and tasted like something from a mall food court. Both dishes were hugely disappointing and a terrible value at $42 and $35. I don't have any issue spending $ if the food is good. For example my son's 16 oz filet was $64 and I had zero issue with the price, as it was a solid cut and cooked to perfection.   Again, the restaurant was well reviewed and the combo steak house/Asian food vibe is/was intriguing. However going one for three (on the entrees) may get you into Cooperstown but it's not going to generate a whole lot of repeat business.\n",

Kim was very knowledgeable of the menu and made some suggestions for us. He also gave us time to check the menu out to make our selections. Kim kept checking on us to make sure everything was good with us. The food and drinks was excellent.  I will be going back and I will definitely recommend Brooklyn Chop House for any occasions.\n",

The Colorado lamb was Fantastic, the baby bok choy and fried rice were also great! My friend had the sweet and sour chicken it had great flavor but was a little heavy on the breading. On top of it all they ran out if Chocolate , so no Hot fudge Sunday! Overall my friend and I still enjoyed ourselves and would still return.\n",

The price tag is a little high but the food, drinks, and service was on point so it was definitely worth it! Natalia T was our waitress and she was great! She made some great suggestions and advised against certain things based on both her personal experience and other customer's. All her recommendations we ended up trying we're definitely on point! DRINKS: were really good and strong! I had the lychee froze to start and bae had a mix of the lychee and red velvet froze ($20 each). Bae wasn't sure which one she wanted so Natalia offered us samples of both to help us decide. Round 2 was the lychee ($16) & coconut/mango ($19) martinis (can you tell I love lychee lol). Natalia pointed out that the lychee martini was really creamy and thick and she didn't lie! It's the thickest lychee martini I've ever had which was a bit unusual but it was really tasty! I finished off with my other favorite, sidecar ($19) & bae had the casamigos blanca ($18) . Now while I live a sidecar, I don't always order it because not everyone knows how to make it right but it was definitely on point! I only wished the amount wasn't so small.  Food: came out freshly made and sizzling! Everything was seasoned to perfection as well, omg yum! I don't eat beef so no steak for us lol. We had the lobster Satay served with peanut sauce (2 pieces for $30) & crispy chicken wontons (5 pieces for $15) as our appetizers. Both were really good & I loved the fact that they didn't overcook the lobster! For our main course, I had the pork chops (2 pieces for $42 but they were nice & thick!) and bae had the spicy nine season shrimp ($42. I didn't count them lol but it was about 6 pieces). Sides are family sized/for sharing & we went with the garlic ginger mashed potatoes ($14), chicken fried rice ($14), and the broccoli & garlic ($17).

Fried rice which I could’ve got from the chinese restaurant was $28 and honest it wasn’t that great.  My total bill was $154! The only thing I enjoyed was the red velvet cake which we all shared because 1 slice of cake is $18. I would also like to include that as we’re eating, the cleaners kept coming to our table picking up our plates and utensils. It got to the point when I had to ask them if they wanted us to leave. I never seen that before! I kept think they either wanted us to leave or had a shortage of plates! I wouldn’t go there again. I think they’re selling the experience of being there since a lot of celebrities ate there but honestly I could get way better soap dumplings and fried rice up the block from where I live and pay wayyyyyyyyyyy less!\n",

      "Processing review: We picked BCH to celebrate a friend’s recent promotion and an upcoming birthday.  My friends got stuck in very bad traffic which caused them to be thirty minutes late—I panicked because I know some restaurants will cancel your reservation—not BCH!  The hostess was very sweet and understanding, she checked me in early and suggested I go to the bar for a cocktail while waiting for the rest of my party to arrive.    I took her advice and to my surprise purchased an overpriced glass of house Chardonnay.  I go out a lot and $19 for a glass of average wine is a little over the top.    Once everyone arrived we were seated and our server, Boukary (such a sweet heart) helped us make some excellent cocktail and appetizer choices.  The Red Velvet froze is beyond delicious, as are the, spicy lamb gyro and philly cheesesteak dumplings. On scale of 1-10—10’s across the board!  For entrees we ordered,  salt + pepper sea bass, sweet +sour chicken, crispy shrimp fried rice and soft shell crab fried rice.  To our surprise all were very average—on a scale of 1-10, we gave it an overall score of 5.  It’s safe to say it’s the apps and cocktails for me!   We were pleasantly surprised when Boukary surprised us with two slices of red velvet cake complete with sparklers! When he introduced himself, he asked us what bought us to BCH— and he actually remembered.  That’s definitely a reflection of the owners.   The only thing we didn’t like—but totally understand is that they gently nudge you to eat quickly and get out.     Other than that I will be going back for cocktails + apps.\n",

I recieved huge head of lettuce split in half with bits of bacon and sliced tomatoes on rim. I have to say the presentation of the food is not what I expected from this restaurant. Probably due to covid but the food is overpriced. 2nd dish ordered chicken wontons. Theses were delicious...no complaints. Entree was short rib. I'm used to short ribs with nice garlic butter mashed potato. This came with noodles!! Complete disappointment. The short rib was very tasty but noodles ruined it. Plus the dish was $42!! Noodles are very cheap and to side it with short rib was ridiculous. Total bill for 3 people $239. 2 orders short ribs, 1 order shirmp dish, chicken wonton, salad, bottled water, 1 cocktail, 1 order fries. This should of been under $200. I'm a foodie. I will pay for good food. This just wasn't it.\n",

      "Processing review: Had one of the best rib eye steaks I've ever tried at this restaurant.  As an Asian American, I particualrly enjoyed the Asian fusion concept as I've never gone to a steak house where I could enjoy a steak with traditional white rice as a side.  Note that this is the complimentary side it with entrees.  My wife went with the spicy shrimp which she said was good.  We ordered the philly cheese steak dumplings to start but didn't taste anything cheese steak in nature.  They were still good so I'm just not sure if that's what they were supposed to taste like or if the waiter got the order wrong.  We also ordered the short rib bao buns which were pretty good.    It was a shame that the AC was not working in what was the hottest day of the 2021 summer but it wasn't terrible in the restaurant, just a tad warm.    I enjoyed the music and ambiance of the restaurant.  Definitely more trendy then more traditional steak houses.    Overall I'd like to go back and try some other dishes and would recommend this restaurant to people.  For the 2 of us, without alcohol, our bill can up to a little over $200 including the tip.\n",

After driving over an hour , I was not going to leave and it was Father’s Day. The service was good, the drinks were weak and the steak was a 7/10.

So they brought us a “surprise” cheese cake with a sparkler and a side of ice cream. We didn’t order it. We of course assumed it was complimentary as we didn’t order it. But they put it on the bill!!

Not very intimate but if you don't care if others are so close they can hear your entire convo, then you'll be fine.\n",

Not to mention we were forced to order everything we wanted at the same time and then the entrees came out way before the appetizer smh. Had I not said something to the waiter we would’ve never gotten it he never came over to tell us they ran out and had to make more he jus made up an excuse on the fly. We had reservations which we showed up on time and still had to wait 15 min standing outside “to make sure our table was ready” Def won’t be returning back here.\n",

My husband also ordered the porterhouse steak which was 48 oz and I ordered the salt and pepper lobster/3lbs. And by comparison the duck looked nothing like the the steak or lobster in size both which were less in weight was more than the 7lb duck.The bill was $486.00. Not what I expected it to be.

I will say that this is a great place for get togethers, special occasions , or just a nice dinner.   My only concern was that I made a reservation for 10pm and still had to wait close to 30 min before even being allowed inside. So, we had to wait outside in the cold.  After 30, min we were allowed to sit at the bar to wait for a table to become available.  I will say that the staff was friendly and tried to work expeditiously to resolve.  I understand that things get busy , but making a reservation is important for me and having a table ready is even more important.  Hope that the experience gets better and management can find a way to work around this. Thanks!\n",

We didn’t know there was a pre-fixed menu for today so that was very disappointing.  They claimed their best items were part of the menu selection however all of the food was mediocre besides the rib eye steak. We had each of the 8 appetizers and had to send back two of them. The lobster and crab options were definitely not worth it. Our waiter was great but still not worth $145pp which was for a family of 4. Not what i expected for a $700 bill and not even being able to order from their main menu! Definitely overrated and not worth the money in my opinion.\n",

It wasn’t until we paid the bill that he (Niko) was rude! He was not satisfied with his tip, and what we did not appreciate was how he left the Restuarant lookin for us - asking for an ADDITIONAL TIP! HORRIBLE!  I’m not sure what hospitality means to Brooklyn Chop House, but I’m sure THAT BEHAVIOR is unacceptable, and not tolerated! It left us in a uncomfortable mood for my friends birthday. However, I will be returning to The Restuarant soon, and I can ensure you that everytime I visit- and I personally speak with a manager and explain why we don’t want Niko to serve us... that’s if he still works there.\n",

      "Processing review: 1. This was mine and my boyfriend's first time eating here.  2. I called prior to confirm the dress code and was told \" dress to impress, but no hoodies \". Knowing that, I told my boyfriend to leave his hoody in the car, which he did. But after being seated we spotted two other individuals with hoodies on, one being a customer and one being an employee. So that stood out to me, because it was a bit cold in the restaurant. 3. No one was available in the car parking lot, so we parked 2 blocks away, which wasn't a problem. But the convenience was having the lot close to the location, hopefully next time someone would be available. 4. Upon arriving, Security was AWESOME so very polite. Upon checking in, Staff was AMAZING. The ambiance was GREAT, Everything was Just so perfect. I did request a window seat, but was told they were all occupied, so we sat in the 2 seater high seat for more of an intimate date. 5. Customer service was BEYOND GREAT, the BUSSERS WERE SPECTACULAR. The food was SO VERY DELICIOUS AND TASTEFUL. The drinks were VERY WELL PREPARED AND MADE with LOVE.  6. The only thing that really stood out to me the most, was when the bill arrived and I was ready to formulate a tip. I said wait, and asked my boyfriend if he knew the name of our server. He said \" no \" & neither did I. Because the first thing we were asked was, would you guys like some water? Never did he introduce himself to us. So when I saw his name to be \" Alex D \" the receipt, I for sure knew he failed to tell us because my little sister's name is Alexandra and her nickname is \" Alex \" so if that name was said to me, I surely would have remembered. Hopefully, he remembers to introduce himself to his future guests. Im also in the food service | customer service business as well and customer is everything to me. You HAVE to love what you do with patience, common courtesy and hospitality. We did enjoy ourselves and this first time experience. We'll be back again. THANK YOU ALLL SO MUCHH !!\n",

      "Processing review: Due to NYC COVID regulations, my friend and I had to sit in their outdoor dining area because there was only 50% capacity allowed indoors. The host/greeter was very friendly and explained this to us. I could tell he probably gets pushback often because he over-explained the situation. Their outdoor space is setup well, heat lamps that actually provide great heat. Service was on point, our waiter was attentive and so was the support staff that brought water, removed/replaced plates/knives/forks. As for the food, we had the duck tacos and lobster egg roll dumplings to start. Both were tasty, but I don’t think I’d have it again. For our entrée I had the salmon and my friend had the bass and we paired it with the lobster fried rice, we really enjoyed our meals. Drinks were yummy. I would definitely return.\n",

Lobster rice not much lobster or taste. Dumpling very thick dough and simple.  Buns were very tasty, but needed a tiny bit of crunch to keep it from tasting like beef stew in a blanket.  Mash potatoes were interesting but nothing I would order again. Shrimp was not too deeply fried which was nice and very plentiful. I did love the bacon it was amazing! Perhaps we should have got a steak instead of the apps.\n",

      "Processing review: Brooklyn Chop House was in a beautiful neighborhood in NYC with delicious food. I highly recommend the lamb gyro dumplings and the short rib bao buns. The cucumber lime cocktail was delicious! There was a fun crowd & I saw a few birthday dinners there. The menu is a little pricey but it was worth the delicious food. My only complaint was that we were sat at a 2 personal bar stool table which was a little uncomfortable but only a minor inconvenience. The staff was so nice & made sure our water was always filled and our orders were taken care of. Overall a really delicious place would definitely go back.\n",

Even with a reservation which they take your credit card to book the reservation you still have to wait. I reserved indoor dinning and was told due to the time they won’t be able to give me a seat inside even though they are the ones who made me wait. We sat outside and the waiter was abrupt and off putting. We were served appetizers and waited and hour and a half for our main course. The steak wasn’t all that great. The mash potatoes and broccoli were very good. But the time we got our food they were closing and we felt we had to rush to eat. Don’t recommend.\n",

The food was not that great, and way over priced for what we ate (a side plate of steamed, flavorless bok choy was $22, for example). I also understand covid time restrictions, but a 1 1/2 hour limit on a steakhouse dinner is quite the rush! Very disappointing experience overall.\n",

While I understand that Covid restrictions impact the dining experience, but you know what your capacity is, why overbook to have people waiting online. My biggest pet peeve, was that the line was being managed the same way NYC clubs are.

The French fries weren’t fresh cut they were chicken shack fries that Cost 1.00 but they charge you 10 dollars for them. The spring rolls were greasy as hell and the grease taste like it wasn’t change in the past 2weeks. My gf got the salt and pepper shrimp and the batter was like a regular  Chinese  store with the same quality. It’s overpriced and over hype! If you’re going to drink and listen to music and look at people cool but don’t go there to eat because that ain’t the place. My NY strip steak was horrible you’re better off going to longhorn steakhouse. The soda was flat as hell these people can’t even get simple basics down like fresh cut French fries. Brooklyn chop house is a scam I felt like I got robbed. This is the god honest truth go there with sweat pants on and a hoody nothing to dress up for. Very very small place and tight people next to you in your conversation breathing on you. There’s also a line in the front with a bouncer and metal detectors. C’mon man are you serious?\n",

They kept pushing us to take a table outside even though I specifically asked for indoor on the reservation. Some people from the reality show love and hip hop where in there asking for a table for 13 so I believe they were bumping peoples reservations to accommodate them.

I am an author and writer for many television shows and requested in my pre deposit for a private table.  That wasn’t even addressed when I came in.  So I guess if you are not a rapper/actor you are not given the same crudités.  My lamb was extremely fatty, not like how you keep some fat on for flavor more like a poor cut of meat.  My lobster dumpling did not taste like lobster was in it, and was brown.  I mean you are paying for the best, and I got mediocre.  I was not impressed.   I’d like to say one thing positive... but can’t.  The neighboring table broke a glass, which ended up on my side, which twice I requested for someone to clean, both times glass chards were left ... what can I expect?  Lastly, I ordered the cucumber mint and it was just a swallow.    At this point, I’m all set.  I’ve seen my friends come through people in the Industry and the treatment they got was exceptional.  I can’t imagine what the general public eats here and the non attention they get.  Oh ... yes I can, because it happened to me.  Lol\n",

      "Processing review: Overall dining experience was absolutely horrible! When booking my reservation I specifically selected that I wanted standard seating not outdoor because it was way to cold to be outside. My reservation was for 5:30. I arrived at about 5:15 and when I spoke to the hostess she was very rude. She told me my reservation wasn’t until 5:30 which I had told her when I first mentioned that I had a reservation. She then told me that even with my reservation and selection of indoor dining that she could not accommodate it and I had to either sit outside or wait 45 mins because she had sat ppl who came before me. So I politely asked her if everyone she just sat had a reservation for indoor dining and she replied no they did not, it’s first come first serve. That’s absolutely ridiculous! So me a someone who made a reservation and selected indoor seating would have to wait 45 mins past my reservation because she decided to accommodate someone else! Very unprofessional!   Against my better judgement I decided to wait because my husband wanted to try this place out. BIG MISTAKE! Once we were finally seated at about 6:15 the waiter was not attentive. The food came out cold and it did not taste good at all. At that point I was just over it and decided to cut dinner short and leave. I will never return back to this establishment nor will I ever recommend it to anyone!\n",

      "Processing review: I came to celebrate my birthday. I had a 9:15pm reservation for indoor dinning. I called at 6pm to confirm the table. When I arrived at 9:05pm there was a line around the corner. I assumed it was for to go orders but was told it was the line to get inside. That seemed strange but joined the line like everyone else. As I’m waiting online with my friends the “host” keeps coming to “check” on us but nothing is really happening. While on line we see the “host” taking people behind us off of the line and escorting them inside. It is obvious as to what is going on. I felt disrespected at the fact that on a cold night in the city that I had to wait over an hour outside on line for a reservation that I showed up to on time for while the girls with fake bodies and fake influence wake inside. No me and and my friend might not be those type of girls, we are hard working gainfully employed women. So when I asked what is taking so long I was told people weren’t getting up and that the Owners didn’t want to rush people to dine within the 90 minute time frame.   We were finally seated it was 10:20. We were told we to had to rush and order our food because they close at 11pm. So because they weren’t rushing the people inside that exceeded the 90 minute time frame, my party now has to rush to eat and socialize in less than an hour. How does that work? I’m so confused. In addition, the waiter told us due to it being so late we could not order any steaks, which was the reason why we came. Also they didn’t have any more soft shell crab or apple fried wontons. Talk about highly disappointed. The night was a total disaster.   Lastly we ordered some food to go. At 11pm they are looking at us like we were are stupid because we are still sitting there. Told the server that we never received our to go order that was place at 10:45 according to my receipt. Come to find out the kitchen never made the order and guess what the kitchen is now closed and the chef left. Like give me a break\n",

I was then told by security that was the line for reservations. The entire statement makes zero sense. We didn’t get inside until 9:15. We waited on line, in the cold, for an hour and 15mins.

The colorado lamb chops (my dinner) were excellent, prepared medium rare with the mint olive dipping sauce.   The best dessert is apple fried wontons with vanilla ice cream, I highly recommend this dessert. The crispy wontons with warm (nearly hot be careful) apple filling with one scoop of vanilla ice cream. It is the perfect finish to this exceptional dining experience.\n",

Our sides, the ginger and garlic mash, and the shrimp fried rice was to die for. I'd go back anytime for that rice. The best part of the night was our drinks. We got the sour diesel.

I had a reservation and it was 4:00 so I couldn’t understand why we couldn’t get seated inside. Yes there is a 25% capacity but no one was seated inside. Reservations are in place for a reason as well as a 90 minute table seating. That helps to monitor the 25% capacity rule and to balance it out with the time slots for each reservation. I’ve been to several restaurants within the city and Brooklyn. They give you an option to sit either inside or outside and it shows whether it’s available or not. The excise we got was “We only seat people outside first then when it’s full then we will seat people indoors.” I had the first reservation when they opened so I really thought my request could’ve been accommodated. I was highly disappointed being that this is one of my favorite restaurants.\n",

      "Processing review: I had been dying to come to this restaurant since April for my birthday because all the press, hype and good reviews I had seen. I was disappointed during my first experience this past weekend. I expected the mix of asian and American steak house to be one of the most tastiest things ever, after going to other steakhouses where the taste is very bland. I expected the chicken fried rice to be more flavorful also. Aside from that I am more so disappointed the experience for the amount of money I spent. The waiter rushed us to order and did not take time to even give us a run down of the menu. The waiter would just stop by every so often to see if we are ready in a very rushing tone. I had such high expectations and am very disappointed. He did make sure to let us know we had 90 minutes to order and eat though. I know covid-19 makes everything tough and you want to sit as many people as possible to make your money, but the experience needs to better in those 90 minutes you a-lot for people to sit. My recommendation is to improve the customer service experience so that it matches the amount of press and hype received. For $182 we could of went to Benihanas for half that price and gotten a warmer experience. Outside seating was very cluttered and cold which is why we waited to be seated inside, heaters were not very effective.\n",

My daughter and I LOVE going here for dumplings! They are so unique! Lamb dumplings, philly cheesesteak dumplings, french onion soup dumplings! We share a few of these and usually a salad and always leave satisfied.   It's not an inexpensive place, on the pricier side - so expect to spend some $$$'s for the experience.   They did a fabulous job with the outside ambience. I didn't like how they told us we would have a 90 minute table time - for that price - they should give you 2 hours! They used the excuse because of how busy they were. It was a Monday night and literally tons of tables were not even filled once. It really turned us off. Plus say that on the booking/reservation site. Turned out all we needed was 90 minutes, but what were they going to do - kick us out if we weren't done eating or drinking? Bizarre!\n",

      "Processing review: I surprized my girlfriend here for dinner to celebrate her 25th birthday and it was our first time at this restaurant. We had reservations for 8:30p. The service was superb. Gave me an \"invite only\" vibe like we were celebrities. Once we were seated, I was already impressed by the table set up. Plexiglass to separate tables, plastic wrapped plates & utensils, and a contactless menu QR code. I loved the atmosphere and ambiance. Very sexy, dimly lit, and music selection was dope. Jillian, our waitress, gave us the perfect rundown of what the restaurant had to offer since this was our first time here. It took us a while to decide what to order because everything looked so good. For our appetizers, we ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Dumplings, Lobster \"Spring Roll\" Dumplings, and the Chicken Satay. Our favorite dumpling was the Bacon Cheeseburger and I loved the peanut sauce that came with the Chicken Satay. For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the 16oz Filet Mignon (grilled medium well), I ordered the Steamed North Atlantic Bass, and we both agreed on the Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice to share between us. My steamed bass was good, but I enjoyed my girl's steak more. Our waitress checked in to make sure we were good and was enjoying our meals. She ended up informing us that we were getting a new waiter because it was time for her shift to end and she was leaving. Which didn't bother us. We just hoped our new waiter would also be good. And he was good. I wasn't able to catch his name, but he still made sure our needs were met. When it was time for dessert, I informed our waiter that we were celebrating a birthday and asked him for the Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake. My girlfriend loved everything about this restaurant and it made me very happy that I made the choice to come here. With that being said, I really loved this restaurant and I would definitely come back again and go down their menu to try different meals.\n",

From the ambiance (outdoor dining but you get the feeling you are inside between the deck they’ve built and how cozy they have it set up. Everything was clean, servers and busters wearing masks and gloves, plates and utensils came wrapped. Food was absolutely amazing and the service Tony gave us was incredible. I have this thing where anytime I go somewhere new, I always ask my server what’s their favorite thing on the menu to help me decide what to get. This time, upon arrival I told Tony we didn’t want any menus but wanted him to pick and bring his favorites/best sellers. I’m so glad we did that! After asking about our dietary restrictions and allergies, he delivered AND THEN SOME. If you go to BCH and Tony is there and you are a foodie (sorry picky eaters) I recommend doing the same. It’s really a nice surprise and everything is so amazing your going to enjoy it! Tony was so helpful, friendly, patient, and professional he truly made it an amazing night for us.

If you're lucky enough to sit under a gazebo then it's nice, but if you get stuck at one of the tables along the side of the building it's just kind of tacky (which is what happened with my party). We also waited a ridiculously long time for appetizers - almost an hour. The appetizers came out right before the duck and the duck itself takes about an hour to prepare. We were not charged for the appetizers and the manager eventually came to apologize for the delay which was the right thing for them to do. It was just kinda sucky because the day we went it was a tad bit chilly and we were just sitting there for an hour before getting any food, so it took away from the whole experience. The food was great when we got it, but things also cooled off quickly because we were outdoors. Indoor seating is now available for this restaurant, but was unavailable during the time we came because a basketball player had apparently reserved the inside. Go figure! All in all, I would definitely return, but only to sit indoors.\n",

Upon be seated we took about 10 minutes to place our, so by 940pm our order was in. We sat awaiting  our food  but it’s now 1030pm (almost a hour later) and we have been served nothing but water.

      "Processing review: This was my second time going to Brooklyn Chop, I went for my birthday in January and was so pleased that I went back with a friend for hers. We traveled from DC and it was well worth it, Jay was our waiter in January and again we were so please with the experiance that we stayed in touch. He actually came in on his off day to make sure our experience was just as great as the first time, this experience was actually better as we tried almost every appetizer they had to offer as well as numerous entree. The servings are already huge so you can imagine how full we were with food to take home. The dining outside is far more impressive then the outdoor dining locations I've seen as of late, theres a temperature check which definately made me feel comfortable given the state we are in, the dinnerware was wrapped in plastic and we were all socially distanced.  Jay brought over the owner who was very pleasent and accomodating, we definately enjoyed the full experience lol so much so that we went back the following day before getting on the road to come back to DC.  My friends and I definately plan on making a trip to Brooklyn Chop a monthly routine! Thanks again for great service, great food and an amazing experience!\n",

The followed all of the Covid protocol and there are partitions between the waitstaff and the guests.   As for the food it was just ok.  We started with the LAMB “GYRO” DUMPLINGS  and the Peking Duck Tacos. the Dumplings were good the tacos were awful. They were dry. Then we ordered black bass and the seabass. The black bass was good but the seabass was dry  Our waitier took a while to get our drinks. Then when we tried to order a second round  and he forgot my glass of wine so I just cancelled it.  Overall, maybe their steak dishes would have been better choice;  but overall I was unimpressed.\n",

I was reimbursed for the meats which in my opinion was mandatory  But thanks for the attempt to be kind It’s just that I order lobster friend rice  And there was no lobster in the rice  Which you did reimburse me for as well  But I didn’t care about the money at this point I was with someone who never been and honestly would never go back...me and my co workers paid a champagne fee sometime mid July and and paid an extra 10 (75) to bring in don julio 1942 we were planning to make reservations for this weekend 8 plus guest I wanted to do the same only time with two champagne fees It’s just that I don’t think you guys care or appreciate our business due to you guys will continue to be booked every day since theres some hype because apparently people like to take pictures of the meal unlike me which I choose to eat good luck guys\n",

Strong coverings outside protected from the rain while carefully prepared individually wrapped plate, water glass, and cutlery were packaged for guest protection. Temperature taking metal detectors?! Before a guest can enter the building to use the restroom - very cool addition. They let us pay a corkage for some Krug a friend brought, in addition to the 8+ Dirty martinis we put back.

Each table was set with dishwater wrapped in individual plastic. Staff were fast, knowledgeable and friendly. Outdoor dining was comfortable.

If it weren’t for Covid-19 and the fact that we had a 9:15pm RSVP and wasn’t seated until 10:42 I would have walked right out. My steak was extremely over cooked and past well done .

      "Processing review: The service was subpar. Even the manager, who we had to call over more than once couldn’t get it right. He offered to buy us a round of drinks, which was nice, but he got that wrong as well. Brooklyn Cop House is an ala carte steakhouse, with a flair, but has the smallest tables so it was hard to set all the plates on it. Some other observations: the veal chop comes sliced but that isn’t mentioned on the menu.  It seems as though the restaurant wants to be a family style place where everyone tastes each other’s meals. Again that is not advertised. One surprising mention: the staff put steak knives at everyone in the party’s setting. When they realized only one of us ordered steak they picked up the others and put them back in the serving tray not knowing if anyone had used them or not. Overall, not worth the money and definitely not worth the rating they get.\n",

We were very frustrated waiting to get our table, but once we were seated we forgot about the horror we went through trying to get the table. Our waiter was amazing and the food came out so quick.

      "Processing review: Made a reservation for Valentine’s Day and apparently they decided to turn that into a prix fixe menu. $175 for two people and they did not mention that when you made the reservations. So we had Perused the menu and picked out all the things that we wanted to order but were stuck getting what they wanted us to eat instead of what we wanted to eat. We got there at 4 PM and it wasn’t even half full.  they offered to let us buy extra food from Menu if we wanted to get a steak but Not only steak. servers were nice but distracted.  The food ended up costing more prix fixe then it would have if we just order it off the menu. That place is jam packed with so many little tables that aren’t even big enough to hold the food.  Literally every inch of the table Realestate was covered up and plates were hanging off the edges. There’s no way the waiters can efficiently move around because there was no space to squeeze in between people and they were constantly having to bump into peoples chairs to get by. I’ve literally never seen anything like it. upstairs had a speaker cranking out very loud music. The food was just OK. The salt and pepper lobster Supposedly 2 pounds was mostly shell they literally cut up the lobster with the shell on it and deep-fried it. Except there was only two pieces of tail in there which means they took out the good parts and deep-fried everything else. No seasoning. It was so terrible. What a waste of $400 for TWO people. I will never be back.  Im so disappointed-based on the reviews I thought It was going to be fantastic.  We ordered a ribeye for an extra $70 because that’s what we wanted originally.  It was cooked perfectly but there was literally zero seasoning on it and they don’t even have salt and pepper on tables. plain meat flavor. Yuck.  Restaurants like this get so greedy during the holidays and don’t think of the customers.   That place was a literal fire hazard of jam packed tables. Horrible experience all around.\n",

      "Processing review: I was so excited to be visiting NYC for my boyfriends birthday  in fact I was a bit confused by how terrible our service was. Once seated we were not greeted for AT LEAST 10-15 minutes. Given it was busy I let it go and was patient, however even once the service did begin the service I noticed right away our server seemed not-so-thrilled. We started with the Satay, and lamb dumplings. We also got two cocktails ; the “blackberry smash”, and the other one was called “This Side of the Bridge”.  Drinks were absolutely amazing but server Did not feature or highlight any of them. Not only did he not go into depth about any of the menu items, but he also hardly came over for quality checks/table manicuring. HUGE No-No when you have guests that are spending big & traveling FAR. Server was very judgmental & negligent. Maybe too tired from fashion week?   I am writing this review not because I didn’t enjoy the food, drinks, or ambiance, but because I HATED everything about our service. To top that off it was very clear who the GM/Owner was. He was dressed very nicely and seemed to be checking in on tables however I noticed he ONLY interacted with 1 table the entire time we sat! I probably starred this guy down atleast 5 times desperately trying to give him the cue to stop by our table and ask how it was going. Instead he would glance back without ever coming over, or just outright not even look back. I felt very annoyed knowing I traveled to specifically eat at HIS restaurant and not even one time were we approached by the GM/Owner. I really expected more and I would have loved to leave 22% as the food  but that service (not so much).\n",

After 7 PM would be the ideal time to go because you should be able to easily snag a parking spot in front of the restaurant.  The dining experience was 5-star because everything was full of flavor. I would caution that the appetizers are not enough for sharing but definitely order one of their unique Asian fusion options per person. The shining star was our 32 oz Prime steak which was cooked to the perfect temperature, wonderfully seasoned and accompanied by a generous amount of “au jus\" sauce. We also shared an order of crab fried rice which was delicious.   The awesome food was complimented by the stellar service provided by Jay. Being a fellow Capricorn, he made sure to pay us enough attention, kept the birthday boy's glass full at all time and even brought up a slice of red velvet cake at the right time. He set the bar so high that I wouldn't chance sitting in anyone else's section upon my next visit.  Looking for a great steak but needing more variety than your usual boring steakhouse sides then this is exactly where you need to dine!\n",

He was able to answer all of our questions since it was our first time here. There wasn’t a long wait for our food. We spent 3 hours here and didn’t feel rushed one bit. And might I add the Philly cheesesteak dumplings are the BOMB! We definitely plan to come back. And they have organic choices!!!! Enough said!\n",

Decided to visit this place from Dallas with my friend (who happens to be a food critic). We were finally seated- asked for order, then to be told 20 mins later that there is not food. Waiter informed that Chef and staff has walked out. Here’s the icing on the cake, waiter noted that Manager would be over to discuss  and assumingely apologize. We waited an add’l 15 mins to be told by waiter that the Manager is busy and won’t be coming and basically we should just leave and they will take care of the cocktails we ordered. This is unacceptable! Never thought this would be how we end the night at 1:30am looking for food that we thought we made a reservation for.  Brooklyn Chop House should Chop it up! This type of service and experience will not sustain a business!\n",

      "Processing review: Came here for my mom's 55th birthday.  What I love about places like this is the ability to order a lot of food for the table and be able to eat communally.  We ordered the  Alaskan king crab legs, sweet and sour chicken,  braised short ribs, broccoli, and shrimp fried rice.  Everything was great, but the short ribs really took the cake.  I'm used to short ribs slathered in a sauce, usually barbecue.  I didn't miss that here at ALL.  I can tell that the flavor was intentionally built as every bite was amazing. Broccoli may seem basic, but it was anything but that at BCH; perfectly steamed, and seemed to be seasoned from within.  My mom and dad are some of the pickiest eaters-- it's often hard to get them to step out of their comfort zone, and they don't hesitate to let me know when they don't like something! BCH got rave reviews from them both, and I'm sure we all will be back. A special shout out to management for being accommodating of my mom's need to use accessibility options as she is in a scooter; everything was done with a smile and I'm so grateful for that.\n",

Bottle of sweet white wine very tasty being I don’t drink but it was so good I had 3 glasses. Surf & turf Lobster tails & filet mignon melted in your mouth like butter!! Beef & broccoli, crispy chicken rice for two every thing was delicious and the chocolate cake is do die for ...super moist cake ..all I need was a glass of milk ...very expensive place but it was worth every penny ...after all it was my 50th birthday..you only live once treat your self !!\n",

      "Processing review: Flew in from Detroit for my fiance's 50th birthday, and have to say that we were both impressed!  Everything was perfect from the ambiance, food and service.  We had the lamb and cheese burger dumplings, along with the shrimp for appetizers.  All 3 were very tasty!  For dinner we had the surf & turf along with the black bass.  The fish melted in my mouth and was seasoned just right.  The lobster tails had a flavor that makes you want to keep coming back for more.  Looking forward to a return trip to NY so we can enjoy another scrumptious meal at the Brooklyn Chop House!\n",
      "Processing review: The service was friendly and hospitable, however, the food was disappointing. The rock shrimp was not crispy. Our lettuce wraps weren’t very hot or memorable. They didn’t have any social spice or texture. The veggie dumplings now use beyond meat. I was not told this and for a good 5min thought I, a vegetarian, ate real meat. They said they just recently replaced the melange of veggies with this meat substitute. For the quality of food, the prices were high. It was a fine experience, but we probably won’t go back.\n",

When asked about certain dishes on how it’s prepared she was not helpful nor equipped to answer simple questions. She only returned once to se if we needed refills on drinks. Luckily the food outshined her performance it was tolerated.  I was disappointed no one acknowledged it was a birthday dinner, usually the miatre d or wait staff would come by with a small birthday gesture. Will not be returning anytime soon.

Also I ordered a virgin mojito and they charged me the same price as it would be with liquor (realized this after I paid and left) .   Nice ambiance which is why I didn’t give it just 1 star.

What disappointed was the service. The place was NOT packed for the lunch rush and we were a party of 3. There was no logical explanation for the lengthy wait time for our food.  The table of four next to us - they sat down before us and their food came by the time our entrees were done! We saw our waiter when he took our order and when we got up to leave.  And since we were running late to get back to work, due to the fact that our appetizers and entrees took extremely long to get out of the kitchen, we didn't realize we were overcharged until after we got back to the office. I called twice and received assurance our check and credit cards will be adjusted. A weekend and two business days later, nothing and at this point, it's simply the principle of it all. We had to return to the restaurant to resolve something that took less than 5 minutes.\n",

The service when we were there for dessert and drinks was friendly and helpful. This place isn’t inexpensive, but it isn’t outlandish for the area. I guess the biggest surprise is that it is primarily Chinese cuisine, which isn’t something you would expect based on the name or decor.\n",

My group had the surf and turf, duck tacos, shrimp and spinach dumplins which were amazing, crispy lobster wontons, also delicious, black bean bejing chicken, delicious, the philly cheese steak dumplins are okay. Loud atmosphere, and tables are pretty tight! Not a spacey place. It gets packed on the weekend!\n",

      "Processing review: On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give Brooklyn Chop House an 8. The food was delicious we ordered the 24 oz. bone in rib eye, pan fried chicken dumplings, lobster fried rice, and duck. The rib eye was delicious and the sauce that was Asian steak sauce and very tasty. The duck is prepared and carved table side which is a wonderful plus and very rich tasty along with the pancakes, wonton taco's and hoisan sauce. The pan fried dumplings were awesome! My only disappointment was the lobster fried rice in which I recommend not to order as it barely had any lobster in it and the pieces that were in it were microscopic so this was very disappointing.  The tables are pretty close to one another as well so if you're not comfortable almost eating in an almost communal setting it might not be the place for you.  The wait staff is very professional and knowledgeable about the selections and they don't hover over you and they check on you appropriately.  I would definitely go back but never ordering the $27 lobster fried rice that's missing lobster!\n",

Once I was seated it literally took 1hr and 22min before my food arrived and to my surprise with the amount of money I spent “we” received small portions. The place is pretty congested on a Saturday and wasn’t the best 1st time experience.\n",
      "Processing review: Went to this restaurant on Saturday, February 16th for my bestfriends Birthday it was recommended to me by another friend who enjoyed her time at the there. I made a reservation for 9:30pm didn't get seated until around 10:30. The restaurant was packed and the hosts seemed overwhelmed because their were so many people waiting to be seated. When the hostess finally seated us we were crammed into an area that barely fit all 3 of us. The tables were super close to one another and she didn't even pull the table out so that my friend could squeeze in to her seat. Once seated we had a server that appeared to be new because she kept forgetting drinks and seemed flustered. I had to ask her what were the most popular dishes since it had been our first time there. So instead of telling me the most popular dishes she proceeded to tell me about each different steak. Drinks took forever to come out appetizers came out at a decent time they were delicious. We received our entrees about 25mins after that, I expected to have a better experience with this restaurant. I know some restaurants have good and bad days so I will possibly give this place another chance.\n",

      "Processing review: We waited 30 minutes for our table despite having reservations. That would have been relatively okay, but the bartenders were unprofessional and distracted and we had a tough time getting drinks. A couple near us said the same thing, so it was not just our experience. They told us they would never come back. Neither would we. Waitstaff wasn’t much better. The whole place seemed disorganized. For example, they brought out dinner out twice!  Lol  As for the food, it was fair. Steakhouse with Asian flair. I would say it was PF Chang type of food and quality.  No offense to PF Chang’s.  I like that place for what it is.  Just don’t charge Peter Luger’s prices for PF Chang food.   Very disappointing, which is too bad because it’s a pretty place.   Overall, terrible disappointment\n",

I left feeling they had better things to do; well so did I. To top it off managment tried to fix things via a phone message that stated the waiter knew we were upset and just waited to give us time to calm down. My friend and I are two women; neither of us raised our voices; we stated the facts in a calm fashion. Just the sheer fact they thought we had to calm down makes me think this place is run by sexist men; please my money is as good as any guy. Oh yeah forgot about the rather large chunk of bone I found in my meal of which the waiter didn’t acknowledge until I stated (in a calm voice) that an apology is due rather then him walking away ignoring the issue.  So my reco is to run away from this place.\n",

      "Processing review: I must say Brooklyn Chophouse has a wonderful cuisine and my tastebuds were thoroughly impressed..when I finally was attended to. I was so disappointed in the quality of service is such an eclectic looking restaurant. I literally waited 25 minutes just to finally be offered water for the table and then our table was ignored again for another 10 minutes. To the point where I physically had to leave the table and get a drink at the bar and watched the supposed server looking bored standing by the bar and she asked me how im doing as I caught her eye and I was just in shock with her non chalant attitude. When she finally came back to our table it was just to tell us she's not serving us anymore and threw someone named Daniel on us as if she couldn't be bothered. Thank god she did that because he was a breath of fresh air and he made up for what she was lacking. Overall, it's hard to recommend anyone as I am not sure if the service has improved, im hoping that was an isolated incident but it surely didn't leave the best impression on me or my best friend that dined with me.\n",

I had an 8:30 Res arrived at 8:20 and didn't  get seated until 8:50. Not sure the point of reservations here. I have been here twice now. During the week its busy, but so far Friday is very busy. Wait service has been 50/50 btwn the two visits, one excellent  the other awful and unattentive, both were friendly. The food is always good. I think it is over priced. The portions are normal. The quality of food is amazing, making the price reasonable. The steaks look amazing look forward to trying them next time. Dumplings were great. Green spinach shrimp dumplings  have whole shrimp not minced, yay! Cheesesteak dumplings  were tasty. Beef and broccoli, Crispy beef, was good.

      "Processing review: I was looking forward to our visit after hearing people talk about it, but was disappointed by our visit.  I came for Restaurant Week since it was an opportune time to check it out and it was clear that they were trying to promote it since I had to ask if the had the menu for it.  I dined elsewhere earlier in the week and the restaurant included the menu with the regular menu.  We ordered from that menu and the regular menu and while the pastrami dumplings were great, the strip steak lacked flavor.  The Filet Mignon Sandwich was tasty, but on the small size for a hungry guy.  Sidenote: the waitress entered the sandwich order in wrong so we had to wait for it since they brought out a steak.  They also brought out white rice instead of fried rice.  I had a spicy mango margarita, which simply tasted like spicy mango juice with no tequila.  The best part of the restaurant is the space.  It's super sexy and the music was good, but it's NYC and you can find that anywhere.  Definitely won't be going back.\n",

      "Processing review: Please note, this is my first review at OpenTable and regularly dine throughout the United States and abroad for both business and leisure.  I am leaving this review since I was thoroughly disappointing by the waitress and wanted to inform any potential guests who plan on hosting a business dinner of the lack of professionalism and training at the venue.  The overall food and experience was good however the waitress was terrible.  The waitress didn't provide an opportunity to taste the wine despite ordering both expensive reds and whites and just began pouring for the table.  Once the table was done ordering, I had asked about sides in order to complete the order and whether we had enough food and provided guidance that ended up with the table with 8 orders of rice (2 per serving) for a table of 9.  The waitress approached the guests and not the host when there were timing issues in the kitchen. Lastly, she was serving peking duck and began using her unwashed hands and touched the pancakes.  The food, the concept and the experience are great but the waitress clearly needs training.  I realize this wasn't a 3-star Michelin restaurant but this was a steakhouse in the Financial District in New York City and she was barely serviceable in a TGI Fridays at a airport.\n",

In an area lacking steakhouses, it would benefit from sticking to that niche with a mid level price point instead of trying to incorporate Asian fusion. The name chophouse is a bit misleading.

      "Processing review: Should try at least once.  Beautiful space but uncomfortable seating, nowhere to put anything.  I understand need to maximize space given Manhattan real estate prices, but at least have a coat check option in winter.  The man at the station by the door was on the phone when we walked in and didn't bother to acknowledge us.  He was busy reading things off the menu to whoever was on the phone.  Another woman showed up after a minute and seated us.  Since one of the selling points is dim sum and small plate options for sharing, tables are not especially geared for that.  Two of us ordered 4 items and it barely fit on the table as it all came out at once.  We cleared a plate to make more room.  The bacon cheeseburger dumplings were on the salty side but juicy.  The pac man dumplings were cute in presentation but uninspiring in flavor, basically a dressed up \"har gow\" (shrimp dumpling).  The peking duck tacos were tasty.  The rice was not \"crispy\" in the soft shell crab crispy rice but it was good.  The apple wontons for dessert were delicious.  Drinks are creative but no happy hour prices at the tables.  Also, if you're seated near the larger tables, servers bring one of those folding trays when their food is brought out so you feel like you're hovering over somewhere else's food.  Overall, the experience was enjoyable.  Not sure it's a \"must repeat\" but would certainly go back if option arises.\n",

We even went early so it would be a little romantic. Service was just ok. The bus staff was on point and our water glasses never went empty, but our waitress never told us her name and was very inattentive. The wait staff was standing at the end of the dining area talking to each other. That and having the big group sat right next to us with plenty of space available is the only thing that brings the rating down. The food and drinks were unbelievable! I would eat here again just for the food. We had bacon cheeseburger dumplings, crispy vegetable rice for two, Kung Pao chicken and beef and broccoli. I can't even tell you what kind of beef it was because it melted in your mouth and I've never tasted anything like it before. Absolutely amazing! They even brought out a dessert for our anniversary. I would highly recommend! We will be back if they can get their service to match the food experience.\n",

The staff were very gracious, but were eclipsed by what we assume was the manager/owner who was bragging about opening “Philippe”. Never heard of it, but we can only hope the food was better than the school cafeteria fare served to us.

The server messed up our order and and did not place our entree order.  When we inquired about it we she said we never ordered it.  After a long back and forth she finally place the order.  This place is only focused on large groups which are loud and acting like it is a private party space which ruins the experience for everyone else.  The tables for 2 are so badly placed you are bumped into all night by the staff.  The owner is clearly not trying to make this a neighborhood place.

So I ate slow so that we were eating at the same time and then all my food was cold when he finally got his steak (Which we had to ask and remind them to bring it to the table).  People tried to clear my food 3 times while we were waiting for his food to be brought.  We watched food be brought to the wrong tables 3 times while we were there and we also saw people start their meal and then asked to be moved because they didn't like where they were sitting.  Seating is awkward, the staff is constantly bumping into each other....all very strange  We wanted to like it but I doubt we will go back.\n",

      "Processing review: Upon arrival (on time at 7:30pm), we were checked in by a young lady at the front desk and was told we would be seated soon.  While standing by the desk, the hostess walked up and proceeded to take a customer who walked in after us, late for a 6:45pm reservation.    The same hostess returned again, never acknowledged my husband and I standing at the desk waiting to be seated.  Another couple walked in for a 7:30 reservation after us.  The hostess then recognized the gentleman and proceeded to greet him with a hug.  She then turned to the young lady at the desk and said, “Let me take them first”.  She never greeted us or even gave us eye contact.  At that point, we were waiting for fifteen minutes to be seated.  I requested to speak to a manager.  I was then approached by a gentleman who asked if we wanted to be seated before seeing a manager in which I declined.  Surprisingly, the same hostess who initially ignored us approached me and asked if she could help me with anything, I declined again asking to speak to a manager for the second time.  Finally, the manager Philippe appeared and immediately seated us after I told him what transpired when we checked in.  Having experience in the restaurant/hotel industry, I must say that this was not a good first impression on this new establishment at all.  Thankfully, our server Daniel was excellent and made us feel comfortable.  I want to say he saved the day after a horrible start at the front of the house.  During our dining experience, I was met with not so nice looks from both the hostess and gentleman who attempted to resolve my issue before having to call a manager.     Upon our departure, the hostess gave us a dirty look then walk away from the desk without a farewell or any parting words.  The young lady who checked us in told us to have a wonderful evening.    Staff is a huge reflection on any establishment and if they are not professional or trained properly, it can definitely result in negative reviews.\n",

      "Processing review: If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I made reservations for 8 pm and showed up around 7:50. Keep in mind I’m writing this review at 11:48 pm. As I arrived with my party of 3 I was told they were clearing tables and we would be seated shortly. Several ppl showed up around the same time or a little after and was told the same thing. We checked back in with the host around 8:30 and was given the same robotic response. “We have diners from 6:30 who just paid but haven’t gotten up yet” I watched as many ppl were told the same thing and grew angry as time passed.. Here’s the way the remainder of the night went:  9:45 pm seated where we placed complete orders 5 mins into being seated. 10:20 we received only one Caesar salad (ordered 2) 10:40 shrimp and lobster dumplings arrived. The owner comes over shortly after with a complimentary salad and dumplings.   We made sure to order main dishes at the same time of ordering appetizers. I expected the wait to be longer, however, by 11:30 we had grown tired of waiting. The owner Stratis Morfogen has to be the rudest person I’ve ever met. He seemed unfazed by me expressing this had been the worst dining experience I’ve ever had. He stated the food would be out in 2 mins. By minute 5 we decided to leave. We were also told we would be reimbursed for one round of drinks. It took them 10 minutes to refund $32, and again, the owner walked away in the middle of me asking why it was taking so long to refund $32. He instead decided to entertain a large party who were having drinks.  With that being said, I’d rather wait in the lobby of a Red Lobster for over an hour than to ever walk foot back into this overbooked overrated establishment.\n",

      "Processing review: So I made a reservation for 2 for Thursday night. The place was really busy but we were seated immediately, which was great. Tables for two were placed in the middle of already narrow room so there were waiter walking by us non stop the whole time we were there, which was about 2 hours. Also, the area where waiters congregated was also right next to our table so the swarm of them was walking back and forth and around through the entire evening. I mean, it was great not to wait for water to be refilled and table cleared, but damn! Too many people standing by our table all at the same time was a bit too much. Also, I didn't appreciate when our waiter asked that we order everything, apps and main course, at the same time since \"they were getting really busy\". I wanted another few minutes or so to study what seemed to be an interesting menu, but his insistence threw me off. I didn't like to be rushed, especially if it was my 1st time at this restaurant. By the time we left there were plenty of tables unoccupied, so his comment seemed weird. Now to the food... Philly cheese steak dumplings were fantastic! I really loved the dough; Cesar salad was nothing special and so wasn't my filet mignon sandwich (it said there were supposed to be onions in it and there weren't any..or I just couldn't see or taste them. Also, since I was rushed to make a descision, I didn't see that there was an extra charge for adding cheese. Again, I liked the bready part of the sandwich the most). The highlight of the meal, besides dumplings, was the lava cake. Delicious! Will I be back? Perhaps to try the rest of the dumplings...but then again, I live on UES and probably won't make the trip down town just to visit this spot again.\n",

No problem, place was packed, really cool venue, happy to wait. A few minutes later another couple walks in, and a 2nd host seats them right away. He catches my eye when he comes back, I guess I looked a bit confused, and he says \"you didn't want the table I gave them, very crowded, not a good spot, we're going to get you guys a much better table.\" Sure, ok, bit weird to condemn anything about a newly opened establishment you work in, but I figured I'd take his word for it. A good 10 minutes later, the hostess tells us to follow her, takes us upstairs to back of the restaurant, and stops, because there are no open tables to seat us. She apologizes, brings us back downstairs, parks us by the server's entrance to the bar, and disappears. Close to 15 minutes pass, and she reemerges and says \"sorry, they're having coffee, and then we'll seat you,\" and then she disappears again. Doesn't offer us menus, doesn't offer even a drink while we wait, just vanishes again. At least another 10 minutes go by, and she finally comes back with menus, brings us back upstairs, and seats us AT THE TABLE RIGHT BEHIND THE COUPLE WHOSE TABLE \"WE DIDN'T WANT\" WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED. The bus boys are still cleaning the table, putting down silverware, etc...when we sit. Hostess leaves menus, and walks away. A waiter shows up, doesn't introduce himself, and asks \"what do you want to drink?\" We were never given drink menus, which we informed him of. He goes \"oh\", and comes back with ONE drink menu. He leaves, only to come back 30 seconds later and ask again \"what do you want to drink?\" I told him we only got one drink menu, so we weren't ready yet, and he goes \"oh\", brings us a 2nd drink menu, and then leaves. And never comes back. We sat for 15 minutes, and no one ever came back to take our order. So we left.\n",

We need to relieve the babysitter, so once the food arrived, asked for the check, which we received 15 minutes later. In addition to the slow service and the incorrect food items, the wait staff was noncommunicative and aggressively rude. We asked to check on our order and he reviewed his notepad to read back what we'd ordered, saying \"it's on its way.\" That's not checking. To top it off, as we sat there at an empty table waiting, the managers (I think) kept asking \"everything ok?\" to the point where my husband said \"No, we've been waiting sitting at this table for over an hour and don't have our food yet.\" We won't return.\n",

Eventually salad dressing was provided for me, several tasty kinds, but with no explanation of what kinds they were.   Was I supposed to taste them to determine?

It's impressive to see the owner also operating as the floor manager and adding his personal touch. The menu may seem a little eclectic, but the dishes are a good complement each other very well. I will definitely go back and recommend to others. Try it!\n",

      "Processing review: We were excited to welcome a newcomer to the neighborhood but were bitterly disappointed.  The food was skimpy, tasteless, and unimaginative -- for example, browning iceberg lettuce for the house salad.  Our waiter was exorbitantly dilatory, and basically disappeared for the bizarrely long periods between servings.  The entrees did not come as described (missing onion, etc.); it was impossible to remedy these deficiencies in our orders because of the waiter's vanishing act. Our wine and cocktails were unremarkable.  The bill was ridiculous given the quantity and quality of the food we finally did receive.  It's supposed to be a chophouse but even the hamburger (two thin paddies) tasted like it was just defrosted.  The waiter never asked what type of salad dressing we wanted but brought out little tin cups for the table with indistinguishable fatty dressings we wouldn't have chosen.  One of our party requested oil and vinegar, and fifteen minutes later, he arrived with two tiny saucers.  The futility of getting his attention again made it too daunting to get more for the others who also wanted oil and vinegar but couldn't share in the minuscule portion.  This, when they're charging $50 for a steak.  We eat out frequently, and have lived in the neighborhood for ten years.  We especially love steakhouses and we have a lot of favorite local places.  But at the end of the evening at the Brooklyn Chop House, I felt the experience was disgusting to the point of false advertising. As far as me and my husband are concerned, they can't go out of business soon enough.\n",

      "Processing review: What a bizarre place. We spent most of the time just laughing about the menu offerings. Pac Man Seafood was a hit! the Bacon Cheeseburger Dumplings were...strange. The steaks were perfect though - but the onion \"side\" was a lot more like a \"pay a lot for a garnish\". It was all just entirely amusing, including the rather novice seeming staff which fell over themselves trying to take away everyone's plates. We loved it for the hilarious conversation if nothing else - and the atmosphere is wonderful. Yeah, I'd go back!\n",

The chef gave us a complimentary dessert (3 flavors of ice cream) i told Daniel i appreciate it the ice cream but I’m lactose intolerant. Daniel bought me out some sorbet and it was delicious! We had the beef rib bao buns,lamb chops , chicken satay, and soft shell crab fried rice.(no complaints) The owner was close friends with biggie smalls (trust when u go, u will be able to tell)\n",

      "Processing review: Great food, great meat. A little ghetto both in ambiance and patronage. The waiter approached the table on average every 5 min, but much more at the beginning (like every 3 min). We felt rushed and ended up making quick decisions on food just to try to keep him away for a little bit. Overall it's a good place for people watching (the partons), and great steak/dumplings. I wouldn't recommend it if you're attempting to impress someone who's at all refined, or if you are yourself (I was embarrassed to have made the recommendation). BUT, the food was really good, and now knowing what it is, I'd go back by myself, maybe at a time where it's probably not going to be busy.\n",
