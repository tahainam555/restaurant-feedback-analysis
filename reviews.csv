Reagan,"Dined on November 28, 2024",2,The service was terrible. The steak was just okay and the lobster was not good at all. Food came out warm but not hot. I thought the food was not worth what we paid.  Probably will not revisit.

Justin,"Dined on October 21, 2024",1,Cold food. Management told us cold appetizers would be removed and they were not. Steak was like shoe leather. Server couldn‚Äôt have helped less.
mike,"Dined on October 19, 2024",5,Beautiful evening as always. I prefer this location over Times Square because of its intimacy. The food is as lovely as the decor. I can‚Äôt wait to return.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 13, 2024",5,"I absolutely loved my experience, was gonna come back tonight but my plans fell through. I‚Äôll be back soon, well worth the 2hr drive!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 6, 2024",4,"Brooklyn Chophouse Review  I recently dined at Brooklyn Chophouse, and while the service and ambiance were on point, the food itself left much to be desired. The staff was attentive and friendly, making the experience smooth from start to finish. The restaurant‚Äôs vibe was modern and upscale, with a comfortable atmosphere that‚Äôs perfect for a night out.  Unfortunately, the food didn‚Äôt quite live up to the expectations set by the atmosphere or the price. The dishes were just okay‚Äînot bad, but certainly not worth the premium price tag. For a place that positions itself as a high-end dining experience, the flavors and quality fell flat. While I appreciated the overall experience, I would have expected a higher level of culinary excellence given the cost.  In summary: great service, nice ambiance, but the food was underwhelming and overpriced."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 4, 2024",5,"Great food and presentation. The menu had a lot of options I didn‚Äôt know how to choose. It was a regular dinner to catch up with a friend until I remembered her birthday was the following week. The server was so nice and gracious. He had a suave Eastern European accent. And took care of us well. We had the kung pao,  shrimp fried rice, steamed edamame dumplings and three deserts bc we couldn‚Äôt choose one. The service here is top notch including the lady with long dark hair who tended to me at the bar, the host up front and doorman. I even got a take out order made to take for family. Will def return to try more menu options."

Devonne,"Dined on September 22, 2024",5,"The quality of the food is consistently impressive, and its freshness is noteworthy. üëç The strawberry watermelon Frose is my personal favorite beverage on the menu. üçπ Every staff member I encountered, from the gentlemen at the entrance to the young ladies at the reception desk and the waitstaff, demonstrated exceptional courtesy and professionalism. üòÄ We will definitely be back in a few weeks to celebrate my husband's  birthday there. üéâ"

Christina,"Dined on September 8, 2024",3,"This is our 2nd time at Brooklyn Chop House and not sure what happen, but food was ok.  We had the lamb chops and fried snapper both were very tasty.  For appetizers we had the shrimp tempura and the vegetable spring rolls. Vegetable spring rolls had zero flavor, shrimp tempura it was very oily and no flavor. For sides we had the shrimp fried rice, zero flavor, unbearable, and the garlic mashed potatoes, which were ok.  We both had margaritas which were yummy.  Staff was very pleasant.  Can‚Äôt say we would go back"
Brian,"Dined on September 6, 2024",5,Everything was absolutely amazing and our server Mike was top tier 10/10 recommend
Kelsey,"Dined on September 1, 2024",5,"Nyla was our server she was FANTASTIC! You all have a real gem in her! Her support team was equally excellent, and very kind and quick. The food was delicious and came out exactly as expected! 10/10 would recommend you visit Brooklyn Chop House."
David,"Dined on August 26, 2024",5,"Always a GREAT experience!!! Excellent food, outstanding customer service, and fantastic ambiance."
Justice,"Dined on August 18, 2024",3,"In my opinion, this place is way overrated for what you receive and for the quality and taste of food you received. I ordered the dry aged tomahawk steak. The meat was chewy, fatty  and unseasoned. Seemed like they just threw salt and pepper on the steak, which I can do at home and put it on my grill and get the same taste without the $159 bill. The mashed potatoes were good and so were the onion rings. We were told by the waiter that we had to order all courses up front which I found ridiculous. They don't give you bread or anything to nibble on while you're waiting for your food. To seat four people they actually take two small tables and put them together leaving a space in the middle in which my drink fell over once the waiter put it on the table. The drink was replaced but you would think for these prices they would have two people and four people tables. Anyway, needless to say I will not be going back to this establishment. I am a foodie and taste is everything to me and for the $410.00 that I spend for 2 people, which I don't mind but this place was no thrill at all."
AIDAIS,"Dined on August 18, 2024",5,"My personal experience with this location is that the ambience was great, food was perfect, and the drinks were spot on. Great atmosphere!"
Marilyn,"Dined on August 17, 2024",5,Honestly everyone was extremely nice and the food amazing!!! Every selection I chose was a 10.
kristinat,"Dined on August 17, 2024",5,"They were so accommodating, the Peking-duck was on point! Loved our whole experience"
Nadine,"Dined on August 17, 2024",2,"This was my first time eating at Brooklyn Chop restaurant. The ambviance was nice and the food was decent. Our steak was not cooked well. The service was not good. There was no server in sight nor anyone to request our needs. Overall, this restuarant need to hire more staff and a chef that can actually cook meat. You can spend your amount at other restauarnts with better reputation."
BrianN,"Dined on August 16, 2024",5,Did not realize until getting the menu that it was a steakhouse with Chinese influence. Interesting and delicious. Our server Yahaira was super hospitable and attentive. I did a Restaurant Week menu but I'm coming back to try the standard menu.
Stephanie,"Dined on August 4, 2024",3,"Based on the prices and photos, I was expecting a more elevated experience. The food came out quickly, though the waiter wasn‚Äôt very attentive. The vibe was a bit more relaxed than I expected, with rap music playing and some Caribbean music as well. Most visitors were dressed in sandals or sneakers, so it was a bit more casual than I expected. Food was pretty tasty!"
Tamia,"Dined on August 3, 2024",5,"I love this location! Everything was amazing, food was outstanding and our waitress was very friendly and nice. Gave us some good tips on the menu and showed us what were some favs. Will definitely be returning soon :)"
Kat,"Dined on August 3, 2024",3,Went for my friend‚Äôs birthday dinner on a Friday night. The place was cute. Service was good. Food was good.
Justine,"Dined on August 1, 2024",5,The food was amazing. We had the 4 course restaurant week meal and we enjoyed everything that we ordered. The food came fast and our server was so helpful and kind.
Christian,"Dined on July 28, 2024",5,Everything about the experience was 10/10. The food was great and so were the servers.
MLoA,"Dined on July 28, 2024",5,The staff was very attentive. Early Saturday evening was calmer than expected. We had a lovely meal and they paid attention to our reservation details to know we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert at the end was the perfect way to wrap up our meal!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 27, 2024",5,Everything was 10/10 chicken satay is my favorite and they prepare it better than most places I‚Äôve had it!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 21, 2024",5,"Great venue, food delicious, staff were awesome!!!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 18, 2024",5,"The best of the best! Food was great, perfect ambiance, along  with great service. This location blew my partners mind. His Birthday Dinner turned out super special."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 15, 2024",5,Sat at the bar. The Bartender is great. I‚Äôve received his service in the past and he‚Äôs always on point with customer service skills. Came for a table and saw the bar was free so I chose to sit at the bar.  I‚Äôve sat at a table here also in the past and received great service from a waiter also who I would‚Äôve requested.
mdcosby,"Dined on July 13, 2024",4,"We had a good dinner here but not amazing. The service was fine, but not special and the same with the food. I would go again if I was doing something in the area but wouldn‚Äôt make a special trip. Ôøº"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 11, 2024",3,"Frequent this restaurant and we generally have a 10/10 experience. Last night the service was horrible - the restaurant was not packed, one waitress was busy watching the soccer game at the bar while the other one was who was supposed to be serving our table was no where to be found. We had to request to put in our order for drinks and food. Everything took an exceptionally long time to make it‚Äôs way to the table, while we understand food - there was no reason we had to wait longer than 20 min for a drink when the bar was empty and the restaurant was not busy. Food is always impeccable but overall customer experience was lacking which was a big disappointment as we were out specifically to celebrate a birthday."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 7, 2024",5,"Fantastic restaurant,  great for all occasions. Food 10/10, service 10/10, and ambiance 10/10. It's kind of on the expensive side of things, but I'm willing to pay for excellent experiences!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 30, 2024",5,Food was great service was great .  Our server Nyla was great
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 28, 2024",2,"First and foremost, my drink was absolutely disgusting and to top it off the lamb ordered as well done came out medium rare with blood oozing all over our plates into our sides. The energy and service just sucked. Which is disappointing because i was actually excited to try this place."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 26, 2024",5,"The Brooklyn Chop House (Down Nassau Street location) was an excellent dining experience offering an outstanding food, customer service, and relaxing atmosphere."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 23, 2024",5,The service was amazing quick and food was delicious. Will eat here again
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 23, 2024",5,amazing for my 50th! can‚Äôt wait to go back SURF&TURF
CoreyS,"Dined on June 22, 2024",1,"Awful Awful experience! I arrived  and was told I needed to take my hat off.  However, when I walked into the restaurant numerous people and all wearing hats. I asked the waitress why other people were allowed and she said oh these are the owners friends. Then we asked her to sit instead of the table in the corner and she said oh you can‚Äôt sit there because there‚Äôs only two of you. Then when I looked up, there were two with two people in them. I asked again and her response was oh, these are the owners friends.  I walked the front and let them know that I will not be patronizing their business when they are clearly discriminating. I went to the Brooklyn, chophouse downtown wore my hat and had no issues."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 21, 2024",5,10/10 I‚Äôll be making another visit ASAP !! I love it
ShirellB,"Dined on June 19, 2024",5,The environment was very much inviting. My sister and I had gone for lunch and we were pleasantly pleased. Everything was great! Definitely a must!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 17, 2024",4,The food was ok taste wise but was on the expensive side for what we received. Drinks were awesome.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 17, 2024",5,The soft shell crab fried rice and kung pao chicken was delicious. They also have a select few mocktails for those who don‚Äôt drink. Good music was played as well
foodDinerYvette,"Dined on June 16, 2024",5,"Their food is always so good and this experience was no different. The food was really good. We got the steak, Crab fried rice and broccoli, for appetizers we had the chicken satay with rock shrimp. Drinks were really good without tasting too strong: white peach sangria frose and coconut mango martini with sour diesel and  Hennessy sangria. Will definitely be back again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 16, 2024",5,Keyana was great!! The margarita tree was so good. The French onion dumplings are to die for. The shrimp tempura is a MUST! Thank you for making my mom‚Äôs birthday dinner so special
katinaw,"Dined on June 16, 2024",5,Atmosphere was at its highest while I celebrated father's day with the love of my life dinner was delicious the service was to ones liking  and the waiter Kabari was so pleasant.  I want to thank the CHOP HOUSE for having us we will be back the expierience was worth every penny
NicoleS,"Dined on June 10, 2024",5,"Had an overall great experience.  Celebrated my spouse‚Äôs bday with our 2 kids.  We were seated promptly and our table server was very attentive. The food was tasty, and well presented. Only oppty was that we didn‚Äôt realize that certain entrees didn‚Äôt come with a basic side of white rice‚Ä¶such as the sweet and sour chicken or salt and pepper shrimp.   Otherwise, all was good and we will go back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 10, 2024",4,"I recently dined at Brooklyn chophouse, enticed by its promising reputation and inviting ambiance. However, my experience was a mixed bag, leaving me with conflicting impressions.  Upon entering, I was greeted warmly by the staff, setting a positive tone for the evening. The atmosphere was charming, with cozy lighting and tasteful decor, creating an inviting ambiance for a relaxed dining experience.  However, my expectations took a slight dip when the food arrived. While the dishes were decent, they fell short of the culinary excellence I had anticipated. The flavors were satisfactory, but lacked the depth and innovation I had hoped for. Each bite left me craving a bit more excitement and creativity on the plate.  On the bright side, the service was good throughout the meal. The staff was attentive and courteous, ensuring that our needs were met with efficiency and a genuine smile. Their hospitality certainly added a layer of enjoyment to the overall experience.  In summary, Brooklyn chophouse offers a pleasant environment and commendable service, but falls short of delivering the exceptional culinary experience I had anticipated. While the food was satisfactory, it lacked the wow factor that would elevate it to a memorable dining experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 9, 2024",5,Always a great time at Brooklyn Chop House. The Bell & Howell chicken is a must.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 6, 2024",4,Server could of been more attentive. Food was amazing and I will come again jus hope to have a better waiter thank you
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 5, 2024",3,Not worth the price. Nothing special about the food.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 4, 2024",3,"Food was good, but it is an odd menu.  Wasn‚Äôt a bad experience, just not a place I‚Äôd go again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 3, 2024",3,Great spot but I think I have to trying the other one to get the whole Chophouse experience but overall not bad. Just one complaint the bartender sucked because the drinks were watered down an too sweet so the bartender definitely messed up the whole vibe but otherwise great service the food wasn‚Äôt the best but it was good
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 1, 2024",5,"You can never go wrong @ the chop house, from entry to seating I've been a few time and it was always pleasant & clean.  The food was perfect as to be expected :)"
Edson,"Dined on May 31, 2024",5,"Fun and eclectic menu with a wide variety of dinner options, along with an extensive drink menu. Wine list is limited but still offers a few good options.  Our waiter was amazing and our group of 6 adults had a great time. Thank you!!!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 13, 2024",3,"My brother took me and my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day. It wasn‚Äôt my first time here, I‚Äôve been here 3 times before Mother‚Äôs Day. However, The food was rushed on this day my brother took us. Maybe it‚Äôs because there was a lot of people there and they was probably ordering the same thing but the food did not taste like it was made with full love could‚Äôve been cooked a little longer and added a little more sauce in everything that was severed. But the staff was super friendly and made you feel comfortable I can say that. But overall I can say they could‚Äôve did better because I‚Äôve tasted better from them."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 13, 2024",5,"I recently took my wife here for Mother's Day and I must say everything we ordered was good. We had our 1yr old with us and had a bit of a task trying to find something. The Chicken Lo Mein was excellent and perfect for the baby. Overall we had a pleasant and seamless experience. We had 2 drinks( passion fruit frozen, margarita), 3 Sides (Garlic Mash, Broccoli, chicken Lo mein) 2 steaks (hanger, NY strip) and the price was very reasonable for the quality of service and food selection. Definitely made My wife's Mother's Day special."

The prices are a bit high for certain items on the menu, but overall the staff were great the food was great and the pleasantry of the staff was even better!

Jack,"Dined on April 21, 2024",3,"I was taken aback by the seating arrangement. Placing 2 seater tables in the middle of the restaurant was uncomfortable. There‚Äôs people walking back and forth while you‚Äôre eating. Coats, bags, people brushing against you as you dine. (Yuck) and we were told we could not move because these seats were designated to ‚Äú2ppl‚Äù . To get to the restroom I was told to walk straight back and make right- SHOCKED I walked into a private party dining‚Ä¶. *shocked and confused face* one of the gents may have seen my face confused face and said ‚Äúyep, you‚Äôre walking the right way‚Äù . Overall food was mid"

Sherilola,"Dined on March 16, 2024",3,I took a friend here for their birthday and we did not enjoy our expensive meal. That's very disappointing.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 13, 2024",5,One of the most unique steakhouses in NY with delicious food. Dumplings were amazing appetizer!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 10, 2024",5,"This is my first time at Brooklyn Chop House . The ambience was beautiful. Felt like I had been to this place before. The food was amazing from the hanger steak to the sides. Everything was just wonderful and flavorfulÔøº. The staff, hands-down was some of the nicest people that we have met they were really great on recommendations on what to get to eat  . If you ever go to NYC, I highly recommend this place a 10 out of 10 for me."
amyw,"Dined on March 8, 2024",4,Service was particularly slow on this visit. It took one hour to get our entr√©es. It's a pricey restaurant. I expect much better service when I spend $350 for a two person meal.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 7, 2024",4,Great place the ambience was relaxing and enjoy celebrating my son birthday here‚Ä¶..
AlexC,"Dined on March 1, 2024",5,3 of the 5 guests have never been to the restaurant before. They will be back. The porterhouse was cooked to perfection. The staff was attentive and courteous as always.

CariN,"Dined on February 25, 2024",3,"Great setting, good food and drinks. We ordered several small plates and shared.  Enjoyed the buckets of fried rice."
Alex,"Dined on February 25, 2024",5,"We went for a birthday. I don't know how they did it, but at multiple points in the dinner across multiple staff (e.g. waiter; hostess), they correctly wished the birthday person a happy birthday + their name. It was a really nice touch that we were all really happy and surprised by.   Thanks to the folks for making it a really nice birthday!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 24, 2024",5,The staff was very welcoming and accommodating.  The water was awesome.  Everyone was a matter of fact  Thank you team at Brooklyn Chop House lower Manhattan
ReginaA,"Dined on February 23, 2024",5,"Food was really good, they were very accommodating to our needs. We had a great time"
LaRondaM,"Dined on February 22, 2024",5,"I celebrated my birthday here and everything was A+! Food was delicious, service was amazing!!!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 21, 2024",4,"Just had drinks and apps.  Delicious!  Great service!  Kind down to Earth.  Atmosphere lovely.  Great vibe.  One minor issue that is a management culture speed-bump.  Midweek, place basically empty, early dining time so there would be no imminent rush.  Told by wait staff we had to order apps and mains at the same time.  Never heard of such, especially during a non volume time.  So‚Ä¶  We only ordered apps and drinks and left.  Had we had entrees too according to our initial plan,  they would have made more money and I would be complimenting steaks perhaps.  The prices for steaks seemed high, but apps were great."
Jace,"Dined on February 19, 2024",4,"It was nice, I took my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. The food and drinks were awesome. The host said Happy birthday to my girlfriend and recommended some of the great options on the menu. However, they didn't bring out any birthday cake at all with sparkling candles or anything. Overall, great calm place for a date."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 19, 2024",5,We sat upstairs in the back very close to  couples tables to the left and right.   It was a bit of a wait for our order to be taken and a wait for the food to come out ( It was worth the wait)  Would strongly suggest you order appetizers.   The table to the left and right of us experience.  Yes we were that close that we engaged in conversations with them since they heard each other‚Äôs conversation.   I frequent this restaurant.   Some of my guests prefer seating at the bar for a verity of reasons and from my experience I will suggest a table if with a lady; the bar with a man
Jhnei,"Dined on February 18, 2024",5,Great place for a dinner or celebration! I loved when we went the food was good ! The ambiance the music 90‚Äôs  rnb loveee it me and my bf went for his birthday it was great cant wait to go back !
Alecia,"Dined on February 18, 2024",4,The food and drink was on point. Just a little pricey.
KillaG,"Dined on February 18, 2024",5,"My first visit to this restaurant years ago was a complete opposite of my past few visits this year and last year. Food and service has evolved tremendously. Nyla was such a great waitress. She was knowledgeable, patient and always kept a smile. Music selection never misses and drinks were pretty good."
Stacy,"Dined on February 17, 2024",5,Food was delicious‚Ä¶they serve large portions‚Ä¶will be revisiting.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 17, 2024",3,The vibes were definitely there and the service was great however the food was mid. Better steak at other restaurants in my opinion. Enjoyed the ambiance though.
NONE,"Dined on February 17, 2024",1,food was abysmal. waiter less than interested in us and so over priced‚Ä¶
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 15, 2024",2,Over priced. I got seated by the door and it was the worst experience It was too cold.
MiMi,"Dined on February 14, 2024",3,"Overall good. The spare ribs, wild mushrooms and broccoli/garlic excellent. Excellent, attentive service. The soft crab fried rice should have lump crab instead of soft crab to make it a thousand times better. And lemon drop martini was tooo sweet for my liking."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 13, 2024",5,"My husband & I had a super great dubiously romantic night we enjoy they music and the calm ambience. We enjoyed our cocktail and the great seafood. We were there to celebrate his birthday day before he head to Toronto, our overall experience was wonderful we will certainly be back again."
NoreenO,"Dined on February 12, 2024",5,Food was fantastic! Signature drinks were loved by all on the table.

KatushiaP,"Dined on February 6, 2024",4,"We had a great time! Celebrated a birthday dinner with friends, intimate setting, staff very attentive, and courteous."
Nicole,"Dined on February 3, 2024",3,"The restaurant was good. It was packed, thankfully we had a reservation. The food was good. We went for restaurant week, and the deal for the price was amazing. The bacon cheeseburger dumplings were amazing. Get those. The drinks were good, but expensive. All in all. Not bad."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2024",1,"Reservation was at 7:30, didn‚Äôt get food until 9pm."
ElaineC,"Dined on January 29, 2024",5,Pork soup dumplings and French onion dumplings AAAAAMAZING!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 28, 2024",2,The food was amazing . However the reception staff and the managers were terrible . We had a reservation at 9 . Part of our group was there by 8:50 . Then the rest of the party came in at 9:08. We were asked to wait at the bar until our party arrived . When our full party arrived we made them aware . They came to the bar hastily and said please close out your tab so you can be seated . The tan was closed however we did not get seated until 9:55 pm . We were pressed for time as we had a show to catch . When we tried to get some kind of clarification they were so short dismissive and rude . 3 other tables were seated before us . On top of there were multiple tables empty. It was just such a bad first experience . However the food was very good . Along with our waiter . But based off that i would not step foot back in that restaurant. The way we were dismissed was just insane
dpNYC,"Dined on January 25, 2024",3,"I don't think the fusion of Chinese, Steak and Seafood worked very well.  Too many things happening.  Individually, the food was pretty good.  Service was good, but a place with prices like this, you should have printed menus and leftovers should be boxed for you.  Scanning a QR code for an $89 steak just doesn't make sense.  And dropping a bunch of boxes on our table to box up our own food is not representative of fine dining."
MarioL,"Dined on January 23, 2024",3,"My partner and I went for restaurant week this year. The place had a lovely ambience with a classic downtown Manhattan feel. Low lighting, quiet music in the background and a feel of a great night out. However, the food quantity we received and for the value was not up to par. The filet minon beef and broccoli should just be called beef and broccoli. Growing up in New York my whole life, I would much rather order from any random Chinese restaurant. The bacon cheeseburger dumplings were not to my personal liking, but the bok choy side was delicious. Overall with drinks and tip, the bill came out to $180 during restaurant week, meaning this would‚Äôve been a $250 plus dinner on a normal night, and for that price, I would not recommend this place at all."
MatthewB,"Dined on January 23, 2024",3,"Drinks were good, and place is like the photos. The food was not great. 'Chicken Satay' as they call it was odd and nothing like traditional (carrot pure breaded). Most of the food was too sweet."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 23, 2024",5,Incredible dumplings and presentation was elevated!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 21, 2024",2,"I arrived at my reservation time and was immediately sat down and showed where to locate the menu using the QR code. However, everything from there was horrible. I had been sat 15 mins and my waiter had not showed up to introduce themselves and see what I needed. After 15 mins, I flagged the waiter walking past me and after stating that I had been waiting for someone to come so I can order / be acknowledged, he responded ‚ÄúI guess I can serve you‚Äù. Before he walked away I placed my drink order, and it arrived after 5 mins, but I didn‚Äôt see my waiter again. I eventually had to ask another person to find my waiter so I could order food.  This is super disappointing because this was my first experience at this restaurant and it‚Äôs unlikely that I will return. I showed up as a party of one, and that was probably my mistake. The other tables with larger parties and couples together had no issue being served. I dine out often alone and did not feel seen or that my experience was just as important as the others from this experience. The waiter was not warm and I had to seek him to get anything. What makes this experience even worse is that I was right in front of the restaurant, near where the waiters based by frequently for materials, so I would have expected for the service to be quicker.  Additionally, my food came out fairly quick. I ordered the shrimp friend rice, chicken wontons & spring roll with two drinks. The rice and wontons were good but the spring rolls taste as if they were fried in old grease and the drinks were not strong. I didn‚Äôt bring any of this up to my waiter because I was ready to go and just wanted to pay to leave. This experience ruined my entire night and I decided to call it a night early."
CristalR,"Dined on January 21, 2024",4,"The lobster satay blew me out my seat. Everything was good, but that particular dish, will have me coming back! If you‚Äôre a foodie this is place is a must."

ThatDude,"Dined on January 14, 2024",5,"At the recommendation of several people, I took my wife to celebrate her birthday.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were blown away.  Everything, from the drinks to the dessert, was amazing and the awesome service we received from the staff was the cherry on top.  It's a little pricey to go on a regular basis, but definitely a place to go for a celebratory meal.  I will be back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 13, 2024",5,"From entry to departure everything was exceptional.  My server Emilio was pleasant n attentive , which matters most to me, presentation with pleasentries go along way with, I do not care for a server being disshoveled serving me food.  I'm easily turned off, hence i don't out all the time!"
FaithW,"Dined on January 11, 2024",4,"Family of four, went for a birthday. Wednesday night, not too crowded. Server, Alex was kind, informative, and patient. Took my parents out who don‚Äôt get out much and they insisted on paper menus and a host of request that would have drove me crazy if I were the server, lol. Yet, Alex was kind, patient and accommodating, allowing my mother to exchange a drink she didn‚Äôt like the taste of. The food was fresh, hot and tasty. We had the Bass, 9 shrimp, Beijing chicken and short ribs. For sides we had veggie fried rice, white rice (came with the Beijing chicken) and bok choy. Everything was so good. Would recommend to others. Make an reservation and enjoy your night out!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 31, 2023",1,Good was terrible. This place is overrated and over priced.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 31, 2023",5,Everything was top of the line. I took my soon to be wife here and that steak was the talk of the night. Everything was amazing at this location from the water to the silverware. I believe you should atleast taste luxury or elegance one in your lifetime and it is exactly here. Brooklyn Chop House just amazing !!!

AkeishaB,"Dined on December 29, 2023",5,My boyfriend and I had an amazing time.  They seated us as soon as we walked in. Our waiter came to the table shortly after.  He was very friendly and smiled the entire time.  Shout out to Boukary N and the entire staff that night.  The ladies at the receptionist desk were also amazing and welcoming.   It wasn‚Äôt my first time at BCH the food is always on point.  Special shoutout to the kitchen staff.  My boyfriends first time.  He loved the ambiance and music selection throughout the night.  He wanted to try everything on the menu.  We‚Äôll definitely be back.  Thanks to BCH for helping me make his birthday one to remember.   The waiter brought out his gift with his dessert. Everyone was in on the surprise. Thank you to everyone.  You guys ROCK!!!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 17, 2023",3,It‚Äôs was good .. I ask if we can switch our table a little more towards the back and the lady looks like a manager automatically said no without even checking ‚Ä¶ when I ask the waiter he switch our table .. took little long to place our order but other than that all good .. oh and he didn‚Äôt give us a to go bag the bartender notice we needed a bag and ask us if he wanted one ‚Ä¶

KrystalD,"Dined on December 3, 2023",5,"Let Me Tell Yall Something ! I Picked This Place For My 30th Birthday. I Heard So Much About This Restaurant, So Of Course I Had To Go And Visit. The Energy , The Vibes Off The Walk In Was Dope. The Hostess Was Extremely Nice And Welcoming. My Waitress Was So Dope. Super Friendly. I Definitely Recommend 10/10."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 3, 2023",5,Our reservation was for 5 ppl. Got there on time and only waited 5 min to be seated which wasn‚Äôt bad. The food was amazing. Portions were large and the taste was impeccable. The only thing i would complain about is the waitress Kiana not wanting to break my tab down as requested. She would‚Äôve still gotten a tip regardless. I had  3 ppl wanting to go on one tab  and 2 on the other and she refused to do it.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 3, 2023",4,It was a great first time experience just could‚Äôve been better with it being our first time and celebrating a birthday.

Nivia,"Dined on December 2, 2023",4,"Service and restaurant was great. Ambiance was nice and cozy. Food was great for the most part, with the exception of the short rib was tasteless needed seasoning and gravy. The Lo mein noodles had too much h ginger and not enough sauce. Price and gratuity was pretty pricy for the food portion.   Be prepared to spend money here as this place is not budget friendly."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 2, 2023",5,"Great service, food and patrons!!! I can‚Äôt wait to come back for the lobster satay, filet and broccoli!!!"
LevisaW,"Dined on December 2, 2023",4,The food was very good and the service from Alex was just as good as well.
JohnL,"Dined on November 30, 2023",3,Steaks were very good. Shared a Tomahawk & Porterhouse. Server was not very attentive. Wine list was lame.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 28, 2023",5,"This was a fantastic place to celebrate a special moment with family and we couldn‚Äôt have been more pleased with how everything went.  Our waitress had a sparkling personality and the music was just at the right level as well, so it was very easy to relax into the moment."
DerekH,"Dined on November 26, 2023",3,"The steak itself was excellent but the appetizer and sides were well below quality. We had to actually assemble our own wedge salad, and the onion rings and mushrooms had no seasoning whatsoever. The service was very slow. We only saw our waiter twice the entire visit. The price was fine for the portion sizes, but that‚Äôs sort of the problem too. The smallest steak was 16 oz, way too large for an average eater. We ended up splitting a larger steak, which was excellent, but also noticed every other table around us had ‚Äúto go‚Äù boxes.  We won‚Äôt be making a return visit here."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 24, 2023",5,Kiana was such a great waitress if you ever come to this restaurant make sure she‚Äôs your waitress. The food was so delicious and cooked fresh to order.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 22, 2023",5,Bess Service  Eat Everything lol Everything is Goodddddd
DeOndraS,"Dined on November 19, 2023",5,"Had a great anniversary dinner. Everyone was professional. Music was great, they played r&b mostly. The food was really good, I had braised beef with low mein. My lemon drop was served in a big glass, which was a plus. For two people our bill with two meals and two drinks was 156. Pricey. But overall it was good. Would return!"
Jamar,"Dined on November 18, 2023",5,It‚Äôs on the louder end because people are enjoying themselves and having a great time and vibing. Let them. I ordered the spicy watermelon margarita - delicious - and the porterhouse Pittsburgh style and it was perfectly charred and salted with a medium to medium rare center. The steaks are more expensive here than I‚Äôm used to at traditional steakhouses so we did not get a side.
JulieR,"Dined on November 16, 2023",5,If it‚Äôs one thing I had to recommend off the menu. GET THE LAMB CHOPS! I will definitely be back.
StephanieJ,"Dined on November 16, 2023",5,"This was my first time at Brooklyn Chop House.  The food is a unique blend of steakhouse with Asian fusion.  Be advised that the portions are quite large and intended to be shared.  This is true for appetizers, entrees and sides.  The appetizers were great...the crab soup dumplings, french onion soup dumplings, and reuben dumplings were unexpected and interesting combinations of ingredients and absolutely tasty.  The scallion pancakes (and the dipping sauce) were unexpectedly delicious for such a simple dish. The steaks were well cooked and properly seasoned. We had the surf and turf; the garlic lobster tails were fantastic and the filet was so tender. The sides were also very tasty.  We ordered the mushrooms, the broccoli, and the mashed potatoes.  An overall great experience with attentive and personable staff from the time we walked in through our departure.  Definitely a treat, but prepare yourself for the cost."
NikkiB,"Dined on November 13, 2023",5,I appreciate the noise level being low. The food was amazing as always.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 11, 2023",2,For the price of the plates I was expecting better quality of taste. The food was overpriced. Unfortunately the waiter service was poor. Wasn't very helpful and attentive.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 11, 2023",4,First of all -this restaurant was very cozy in a good way . The food from the appetizers to the entrees were all overall good . The ambiance was nice . The music selection was great - I just wished the volume was turned up higher . My husband and I enjoyed all parts of this restaurant. Thank you for having us .
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 10, 2023",3,Mixed drinks were not up to Par.  Too fruity and similar.  The old fashion was way too fruity and not an old fashion at all.  The Lychee martini was good and not common which was unique.  Drinks were okay but not up to the price being charged.  The chicken saut√© was ok.and nothing to brag about.  I would recommend ordering something else. Steak and lobster were very very good!  They nailed the seasoning on the steak and medium rare was actually medium rare which was on spot. I would not recommend the lobster with the ginger sauce but it wasn‚Äôt bad.  I just could have used something additional In the flavor department. Garlic ginger mashed potatoes were pretty good.  Order the steak.  And the service was awesome!  Environment was good and people were friendly.
melonieb,"Dined on November 10, 2023",5,Overall excellent service and the food was delicious.
RandyL,"Dined on November 9, 2023",3,"Best way to describe the dinner was ""weird"".  A ""Chop"" house with a asian flair might of been better (food was pretty good) but they make you order everything all at once (so you over order) and then after the appitziers they brought the soup, salads and dinner all at the same time (weird).  Very obvious the server and likley her management has never been to a fine ""Chop"" house before.  Also, only about 30% full which is weird in NYC on a Wednesday night.  And, the wine list is very small for a ""Chop"" house and the years of the wine listed they did not have for the two bottles we ordered."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 8, 2023",2,"Informed restaurant prior to turning up that my son had a nut allergy and it was his birthday. His appetiser had nuts in it, and we were made to feel stupid that we should have known better. At no time was it acknowledged by them that they were aware. There was no reference to my son‚Äôs birthday at all. Food was bland. Food overpriced. Music was great and not loud. Staff collecting plates were nice. Our waitress not so much. Travelled from England and felt that we had to come to this restaurant but was extremely disappointed."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 6, 2023",5,"Celebrating my daughter 21st birthday was special and that was all due to our Amazing services by Emilio.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 5, 2023",5,As always the food did not disappoint. I was a little disappointed with the wine selection and ended up drinking Tequila instead with my meal.  The waitstaff was great and very attentive.  Appreciated them for always checking in.

Tazman,"Dined on November 4, 2023",4,"The food was excellent, the service was only fair, I arrived with 5 of my party of 6, 5 minutes prior to our reservation and was told we could not be seating without everyone being present.  Not unusual for a Friday night in NYC, but the reason stated was new, the waiters are only allowed to place one food order per table.  We were about to leave to go to a local bar to get a predinner drink when the hostess seated us.  We were told by the waiter that we need to order all food at once.  We did as we were told ordering several very unique dumpling appetizers and steaks.  I specifically requested the appetizers come out first, I was told that would not be an issue.  About 20 minutes later our steaks came out without appetizer.   Our waiter was upset and was in the process of taking them back to await our appetizers.  Not wanting cold or over cook steaks, we decided to skip the appetizers.  Again, the steaks and sides were excellent, but if you are looking for a muti course dinner, maybe look elsewhere."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 3, 2023",5,It was simply amazing from the time we walked in to we left .
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 30, 2023",1,Awful overpriced ‚Äúfood‚Äù. Will never come back here

KimM,"Dined on October 28, 2023",4,I really enjoyed dining at Brooklyn Chop. The music and drinks were great and the service was good as well. Some of the food was pretty good but a lot of it was just okay. I will be back to try other items though because the menu is pretty extensive.
PrincessS,"Dined on October 27, 2023",5,"I hate that I was unable to get her name but the fair skin, very pretty, middle aged manager made my experience quite pleasant. My party had some reservation issues and wanted to sit next to another party. The manager was very understanding and accommodating. Throughout the night she continued to check on both parties ensuring we were pleased with the service. I‚Äôve been to Brooklyn Chop House 3 times prior and I‚Äôve never had a manager so engaged with the business.  She was very down to earth, she cracked a few jokes with us and made sure we had a great time. As managers and supervisors ourselves, the entire party appreciated the great customer service. Other than that the food and service from the staff is always a 10 out of 10. Very pricey but you get what you pay for. The waiter was able to make good recommendations for my friend based on her personal taste & she loved the suggestion. Overall, great experience. Thank You !"
Imjustcope,"Dined on October 26, 2023",5,Food and drinks were excellent. I will definitely be back again
Robert,"Dined on October 24, 2023",1,Corner takeout chinese food quality. Fine dining restaurant prices.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 23, 2023",4,"Definitely wonderful ambiance for a date night out.  Drinks are good. The music was great and so was the service, however, you are not getting the best bang for you buck food wise. The prices are too high for the, in my opinion based spices used on every dish.  My gf and I ordered the Colorado rack of lamb. All fatty meat. We were disappointed because we dine at the finest restaurants in NYC and wherever we travel.  We heard so much about this place via social media and decided to try it out for our anniversary and while we have a great time enjoying each others company we mutually agreed we probably won‚Äôt visit again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 22, 2023",5,1st time my wife and I visited. Staff was extremely nice and we felt it wasn‚Äôt an act. Drinks and food were delicious. Perfectly cooked. Dinner was at 7pm on a Saturday. Wasn‚Äôt crowded when we first arrived and the noise level was very low. Nice! As the time went on it became very noisy. Overall we will return if in the area.
Vivaladiva,"Dined on October 22, 2023",5,Service was attentive and food was good. Cool menu with Asian flare but also steaks for ppl who eat them. I had calamari and fried rice. Loved it!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 16, 2023",2,Food was expensive but meh! The service was just ok. The drinks were pretty good. Overal not worth the value.
JewelG,"Dined on October 15, 2023",3,The NY strip was the only thing I enjoyed. We sent back the cheeseburger dumplings and the sweet and sour chicken those were not good at all.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 15, 2023",5,"This was my second visit to Brooklyn Chophouse. It is my favorite restaurant to visit when I stay in Brooklyn. We had the lamb dumplings which were bomb. Also, we had lamb chops, hanger steak, garlic mashed potatoes, and broccoli. Everything was delicious! Book early in advance, it gets crowded."

JPHOUTX,"Dined on October 11, 2023",5,The food was perfect and the waitstaff was very helpful and right on point.  I would recommend and return.
RlynW,"Dined on October 8, 2023",3,Service was horrible. The waiter barely never stoped at our table to check on us after we were seated. She took our order (and was a bit rude) and disappeared. It was our first time there and we will never return.
NicoleW,"Dined on October 8, 2023",3,"We had a reservation for 8pm,and we were seated at 8:40pm. Our order was taken at 9. Our waiter was great and the food was amazing. However, I think they are understaffed and should decrease reservations in order to provide a more timely service."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 8, 2023",5,"Great food, great service and great ambience! I would go back! But $20 cocktails a bit pricey!"

TerranceD,"Dined on October 7, 2023",4,Great location   Price is decent vibe is nice for a date night would recommend
Andy,"Dined on October 5, 2023",3,"Strange menu - steakhouse plus Asian. Steaks were just ok but very expensive for the size and quality. The name ‚Äúchop house‚Äù is misleading in my opinion. The server was overwhelmed, as he was mainly focused on a large party in another area. Won‚Äôt be returning."
DanielA,"Dined on October 1, 2023",3,food was good but service could have been better . For the price it should have been a better experience
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 27, 2023",2,"Great food but terrible service. Not too busy, plenty of staff but most playing on phones. Waitress barely said hello just wanted to take our order. Never refilled water. Never offered more drinks (we wanted to buy more but went somewhere else). Had to ask several times to eventually get the check. Definitely not what I expect when I‚Äôm spending $200 per person on a meal."
JanineO,"Dined on September 25, 2023",4,"I've heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. Overall it was good.. lots of dumpling options,,,Hanger steak and potatoes were delish! Server was attentive"

StephanieP,"Dined on September 19, 2023",5,Great vegan options for appetizers and small plates   Would have liked vegan options for main course
Nicole,"Dined on September 17, 2023",3,I tried the Shanghai salmon and lobster spring roll dumplings this time which was just okay and the service was kind of slow. It was still a pretty decent experience.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 12, 2023",5,Great food as always. The service is always great as well.
RaymondD,"Dined on September 11, 2023",4,"My significant other and I were due for date night and Brooklyn Chop House was nothing short of AMAZING.  The staff was great , and the food was even better.  Can we pleaseeee get into the Frozesssss , again AMAZING. We WILL be back ."
MichaelP,"Dined on September 11, 2023",4,"The food was good and the staff made every effort to accommodate us but they were understaffed with Waiters and drowning in Bussuing Staff. A loud and energetic, ""family and friends"" type restaurant (a dozen Birthday celebrations) with some top cuts of beef, Now that we know what it is, I suspect we'll return"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 10, 2023",5,Great food & service. The ambience was on point and the flavors immaculate
GBird,"Dined on September 8, 2023",5,"Bourak was an excellent server!  I was in NYC for NYC Fashion Week and was seeking some really good food, and boy! did we hit the jackpot.

LisaJ,"Dined on September 4, 2023",4,"The food was delicious!  Would def return to bklyn chop house for the food.  Service was okay. We ordered and our food was served in less than 10 mins.  We hadn‚Äôt received our drinks yet.  I think our waiter could have been more attentive, checked on us more and helped stagger service so that we could enjoy every aspect of our meal in stages and not all at once."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2023",3,"Chicken Satay came cold, Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings didn‚Äôt have that Cheesesteak taste; I asked for a drink and the waiter decided to upsell me with a shot when the drinks came. Saw multiple tables sear after us and get served before us. Entrees were good, and service otherwise was good. Not sure what the theme is of the restaurant to be a Steakhouse or over priced Chinese Food spot‚Ä¶Not worth the price and the hype. Feel like people come here for the social media hype and not for the food. Shoutout to the guy at the door for the parking hook up though‚Ä¶lol!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2023",5,I go there at least once a month ! Love it there ! The chicken lettuce wraps and the apple pie wontons are my absolute faves !!  You must try it !
MurielC,"Dined on September 3, 2023",4,"I arrived at the restaurant with my fiance for his birthday and there was a gentleman outside that opened the door for us which was nice. The young lady at the hostee's desk was so nice and soft-spoken. We were escorted to our seats It was decent seating it was next to a family but they were pretty quiet and so were we while talking at a lower level than usual. Now the food was amazing, for starters we had two impress tonics I didn't really like it but my fiance did. Then the waiter came back to take our order for food. So we shared calamari which was really good, especially with the dipping sauce. For the main dish, I had vegetable flat noodles with bean sprouts which were seasoned so well and tasted really good, my fiance had white rice with spicy kung pow chicken which he really enjoyed.  Overall  I liked the casual vibe they had going and the waiters were very nice which helped."
Fatima,"Dined on September 3, 2023",5,Great service and food. Everything tasted really good. The drinks were different but delightful. I have nothing bad to say.
JulietteH,"Dined on September 1, 2023",3,When I ordered the chef salad with the grilled chicken I asked for ranch sauce to be put on there. When I received my food the salad was so dry no dressing on there I had to request a side of dressing.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 28, 2023",5,I had such a wonderful experience and our Server was amazing!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 27, 2023",5,Loved everyone about the place glad we took the drive and got to experience Brooklyn Chop house drove all the way from Maryland most definitely planning on coming back.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 17, 2023",1,"Overrated and overpriced. The food was very mediocre compared to high end steakhouses we typically dine & frequent. The menu had variety, but lacked substance. However, the drinks were good and our waiter was attentive."
MoLANY,"Dined on August 17, 2023",5,excellent service and the food was delicious. great for groups.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 5, 2023",5,TOP TIER! The service was phenomenal! Perfect date night or special occasion.
AltitudeBrown,"Dined on August 5, 2023",5,"It was easy to get a reservation and when we arrived, the greeters were very welcoming and even gave us a little history about the restaurant and it's owner.  The food was delicious, everything is served for two....order accordingly. I wish there was more vegetables offered on the menu, but this seems to be a universal problem. I went on a Friday night and the music was set for a date night- kind of weird since I was with my homegirl, but at least they played good hits. I'd go back again, with a hefty appetite. I already know what I'll try next!"
FRANKLINW,"Dined on August 4, 2023",5,Great food and professional service. Nyla was Excellent!
MarkB,"Dined on July 29, 2023",3,I enjoyed it but I didn't love it. We had and early reservation so we were seated at booth near the bar. Great table. Server was very nice gentleman upbeat and pleasant.  Food wise we probably ordered 8 or 9 items in total. For the most part it was good. The Hanger Steak/ Mashed Potatoes/ Side Bacon were great.  Duck tacos/ Pastrami Dumplings/ Glazed Ribs were good. The Softshell Crab was fried in what felt like tempura batter and it took away from the crab it also smelled a little fishy.  The Crab soup dumplings left more to be desired.  Overall good meal and nice service. The only other thing was that the music kept cutting out in the middle of songs.  That went on the entire night
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 28, 2023",4,"The food was delicious.  We had fried lobster tails,prime skirt steak, and vegetable spring rolls. The only thing was that the spring rolls were greasy. Oil needed to be drained more. Drinks were very good."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 28, 2023",5,"Always great food, great drinks and great music!!!"

PatriciaB,"Dined on July 24, 2023",5,"We ordered drinks with lychee and the calamari appetizer which were delicious. We had the Shanghai salmon, lamb chops and that tomahawk steak. Our sides were chicken fried rice, white rice and ginger mashed potatoes. For dessert we had the New York cheesecake, regular ice cream sundae and everything was superb. My expectations were very high considering the location and the prices. I was not disappointed. I can't wait to visit again. The ambiance was very nice, comfortable conversation level with light music and our waiter was very attentive."
antwanw,"Dined on July 23, 2023",5,"It was my bday and I had a wonderful time . The music , food , and ambiance were STELLAR. I turned my sister to a Chop House groupie"
RodneyC,"Dined on July 23, 2023",5,"Although,  I made reservations, we were late due to traffic.  I called the restaurant to inform them that we were running behind schedule,  in order to keep our table. We get to the restaurant and spoke to 2 hosts( one hosts said 2 minutes,  because they were cleaning off the table and the other said about 30 minutes). We were confused. I will say that, the Lamp Chops were good, the mash potatoes were cold and the garlic Broccoli was warm. My date didn't like the overcooked Filet Mignon.  The music was good to listen, although to loud. We couldn't hear ourselves talk.  But, we did enjoy the casual dress code and ambiance.  It was good experience."
Nene,"Dined on July 22, 2023",5,The service was amazing. The food was top notch! I would recommend this place over and over again.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 22, 2023",4,"Service was attentive, lobster satay was great and so was the appetizer shrimp, but the braised short rib lo mein was pretty dry and lacked flavor, so I sent it back. Could‚Äôve just been an off day. Waiter was kind and quickly replaced it with a dish I preferred. Overall, I‚Äôd return and try something else!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 16, 2023",5,I dont understand the bad reviews. The food and drinks were great. The service was outstanding. They bought out a cheesecake for my fianc√© birthday without me asking. Only bad thing was I wanted to order everything on the menu. I will be visiting again.
whitneyp,"Dined on July 16, 2023",4,Over all good. Food was delicious.  Wouldn‚Äôt order dumplings again though. Steak was delicious and so were ribs. Over all I would go back
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 16, 2023",5,"Love this location! Food is amazing as always. My only (minor) complaint would be for our waiter. He wasn‚Äôt as attentive and my friend and I felt rushed, given the other waiters we‚Äôve had a previous times."
LynetteJ,"Dined on July 16, 2023",5,I‚Äôll start with our server Boukary who was attentive and knowledgeable and answered all questions we had about the menu. Food came out hot and was delicious.

TANK,"Dined on July 4, 2023",4,"3 of us was here yesterday and Temperature control was an issue especially it being a very humid day. Also remembering being there a year ago( July 1st, 2022) having the same issue but with a bigger group for my birthday. Frose beverages which we ordered was more of a watery slush than other Frose we have had. Temperature maintenance is an issue."
YasmeenJ,"Dined on July 4, 2023",4,"This Restaurant has been on my radar for sometime now. I decided to have a small birthday dinner at the lower Manhattan location. The food was everything, crab fried rice and bok choy was my favorites. Overall the food and drinks were really good. The service was ok,  the clearing of the table and the staring from the wait staff was uncomfortable. My party was a little annoyed by that. We wanted to chat view the menu before deciding on our order,  however we felt rushed. At one point we had to tell him, WE NEED MORE TIME.  Once the food arrived, as we are eating, the staff kept hovering over our table a bit. Overall we did enjoy ourselves, the surprise slice of cheesecake with the sparkler was a great birthday treat. I would recommend and return."
DreaD,"Dined on July 3, 2023",5,Food & service was amazing. It was our 1st time I brought my bf here for his birthday & he loved it ! Alex our waiter was the best the freaking best loved every moment. Will definitely be back & suggest to others as well!!! Thank you guys very much !!

AngelaM,"Dined on July 1, 2023",2,This was someplace often talked about ao took my wife to see what the talk was about. Would have to say a disappointment.  Sitting down thought it was a little tight and didn't like sitting in the middle if room with so many walking past but did like the mood that was set with the dim lighting and music playing. Service was horrible. Water came immediately but kept forgetting to bring things we ask for such as a straw. Tipped min standard but regretted it because he didn't deserve it but the bust boy was helpful. Food was was not worth the money. Order the steak and lobster for 2. Steak over cooked as well as the lobster and both very blan. Also got sweet and sour chicken and asked for it without the sauce. Showed up to the table covered in sauce and he says he forgot. When getting my order they were very chewy and some hard. Overall would say it was a waste of money and time going to the city. Luckily NY is a cool spot and strolled around the city to make the trip with it. Would not be going again

karinac,"Dined on June 23, 2023",2,"My food and my cousins food was a bit over salted ‚Ä¶still good nonetheless. Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the ambience. Played ice spice, two chainz at a steakhouse ?

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 19, 2023",4,"We sat outdoors in which they had the flatware & glasses wrapped in plastic which I liked but the only issue was taking the plastic off. There was a lot of dust on the outdoor seating so when taking the plastic off, some particles fell on the plate. I would definitely sit inside next time. The food was great especially the shrimp fried rice"

KerishaH,"Dined on June 18, 2023",4,"Overall a very good experience and I would dine again! The food was definitely good but I wouldn‚Äôt say excellent or mind blowing tbh and quite expensive for what it is. We ordered a variety of dumplings, small plates, lobster/steak, everything was very good but I wouldn‚Äôt say great. Still, the service was great and the location is awesome, also really great drinks. You‚Äôre mostly paying for the vibes here which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. I will say our server was awesome and very attentive! There was an error with one of our orders and he caught it right away and was prompt in fixing it, we didn‚Äôt even have to ask because he was super attentive. We were celebrating Father‚Äôs Day early and everyone treated my partner so nice on his special day!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 9, 2023",2,"I had a Party of 6: Came here for my Baby Bros Bday, Seated immediately, But our waiter was not attentive as should be for this known place, his recommended drink, ‚ÄúMezcal Old Fashion was a diabetics nightmare!!  Now the food that was was the Awesome Colorado Lamb Chops, Peking Duck Tacos, Mayo Prawns, lobster fried rice, shrimp fried rice, hanger steak was good, garlic mashed potatoes.  Subpar: Philly Dumplings, Pac-Man dumplings could have been warmer.  Note:  The waiter should let you know that the 20% tip is included in your overall bill and anything else is an additional tip, however we did not receive that communication and almost assumed another 18%-20% should be added to our already $720 bill.  Soooo becareful!!  The ambience is good, however I get privileged vibes in lieu of welcoming vibes like we should be privileged to be in this establishment and that‚Äôs not cool, but cool looking place."
Patrici,"Dined on June 9, 2023",1,The food was absolutely horrible. Glorified Chinese food. Drinks were good. That‚Äôs it.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 4, 2023",2,We had an 8.30. Reservation but got seated at 10.30 because they had an industry party on and didn‚Äôt allocate the correct number of tables for dining customers! Really bad management!
NicoleH,"Dined on June 4, 2023",5,Great time! Food was excellent.  Ambience was amazing.

dreenaA,"Dined on May 28, 2023",5,I was alone on my anniversary night and everyone including the security made my day and I‚Äôll definitely be coming back.
Livvy,"Dined on May 28, 2023",3,"The menu needs serious revamping.. flavors were either bland or too overpowering, no in between . For the price of the entire meal, I expect a much better experience when it comes to the food. Also the fries were worst than mcdonalds fries.. I wouldn‚Äôt rush to come back here. Drinks, service and ambience were the only saving grace."
LuzB,"Dined on May 28, 2023",5,Our waiter was fantastic and even recommended a second place to continue the evening

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 22, 2023",5,We had the glazed ribs as a starter. The glazed ribs were kind of tough. Then each NY strip. Was delicious. Garlic broccoli was kind of hard. The pork fried rice was soooo good. We received a complimentary velvet cake with sparklers for our birthday celebration. Will go again but try something different.
Tyrant,"Dined on May 21, 2023",1,"Asked waiter to be seated else where because I wanted somewhere more private for me and my wife to discuss some personal things, but I was seated near the entrance where it was loud and people would walk by often. I was told it would be an hour wait if I wanted to exchange seats, obviously I wasn‚Äôt going yo wait as it was already late to make another reservation elsewhere. Ended up ordering sparking water twice because the initial waiter did not cater to our request on time. Ordered the penthouse steak and it was the worst steak I had ever tried. No flavor whatsoever, will be jaded from this experience and probably never try the penthouse ever again, but overall would never visit again, there‚Äôs better steakhouses that would accommodate to better service."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 21, 2023",5,It was phenomenal! My second time here and the food was delicious and I love the music the play.
Crissy,"Dined on May 19, 2023",4,A wee bit disappointed in the size of the double height chocolate cake. It was not what I enjoyed the last time I was at the restaurant. It was pretty small and did not stand on top of the plate.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 18, 2023",5,"I found this place on tiktok. I wanted to celebrate my fianc√©s birthday and loved the way it looked on all videos. This place did not disappoint at all. From beginning to end it was such a good vibe. The food is 10/10 & the service was amazing, I felt comfortable, my waitress was very attentive. I wrote a message with my reservation to celebrate his birthday, and I did not have to remind the waitress. Dessert time came with a flare candle lit up. Side note; the waitress was adorable, she made sure my camera was ready before coming out with it. So satisfied. Absolutely perfect. I cannot wait to go back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 15, 2023",5,Mother‚Äôs Day üíê was awesome. The staff was handing out roses for all the moms it was so sweet. The food was amazing per usual and I discovered the Tropical Punch as my new drink üçπ. 10/10 recommended.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 15, 2023",1,"we had a reservation, and I still had to wait almost 2 hours. they told us they overbooked people because they thought everyone will cancel. Ôøº"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 15, 2023",2,"I was there yesterday, Mother‚Äôs Day with my 2 kids. I had a 5pm reservation and was sat down around 5:30pm. The waiting area, we basically was standing on top of people as every that had a reservation was pushed back. The hostess in the front had an attitude. I get it holidays are overwhelming but they should have patience like they expect us to have. Sitting down finally, the waiter came about 10-15 minutes later just to introduce himself and then came back 10-15 minutes to take our drinks. Upon returning with the drinks, he took our order. I‚Äôve been here multiple times and the mash usually comes on the tin to share. Today it came in a bowl that was for person. When asked he seemed bothered and said they don‚Äôt serve it like that anymore. That is something that should had been discussed from jump. When the bill came, I was charged differently from what the menu showed. He quickly fixed that. I rarely look at the bill but I‚Äôm glad I did. L The food overall is always good but I won‚Äôt go back on a holiday. The service is way better on a regular day."
GLYNNP,"Dined on May 15, 2023",5,Went for mother's day. Waited about 10 minutes for a table at 430pm. My only gripe. The food was excellent and the waiter was very attentive once he showed up. My new favorite spot.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 14, 2023",2,The wait staff was overworked maybe they were too busy but the waiter barely come to the table to see what was needed and the food that came out wasn‚Äôt the best

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 6, 2023",2,"Drinks 3-10 I asked for Tito's and cranberry and they forgot to give me the Tito's and charged $18 really, we also asked for Lychee Martini and received a pina coladaüòî, Decor 10-10, seating 6-10, Food 4-10 the food was like as if Outback and PF Chang's had a Baby and named it Brooklyn Chophouse, service 4-10. I had better service in PF Chang's and Outback. Location 5-10. Don't believe the Hype. I will not return."

MichaelT,"Dined on April 26, 2023",5,"We tried a little bit of everything from the dumplings and they were all amazing. The Pastrami was a favorite along with the Lamb and the cheeseburger. The LSD for the table was so good, the porterhouse, duck and the fried rice were all so good. If you still have room, try the apple wontons."
Megs,"Dined on April 23, 2023",5,It was a great time and atmosphere! It does get busy but its normal to see on a Friday. The drinks was great as much as the food was. My friend enjoyed her birthday!  Our waiter was gre

TheFaithfulDiner,"Dined on April 9, 2023",5,"The food was absolutely fabulous.  I‚Äôve heard so many things about this place and it didn‚Äôt disappoint.  The staff were pleasant and very attentive.  The prices were a little higher than I expected but again, the food was fabulous.  I will say the dim lighting doesn‚Äôt help with the ambience.  Turn the lights on in restaurants where people have to walk on different levels to enter and exit the restaurant."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 9, 2023",5,I went for my gf‚Äôs bday. We drove from Philly to NYC for the weekend. It was great from start to finish. He even surprised us with birthday cake without me having to ask. Thank you for the kind service and we will be back.

Victoria,"Dined on April 2, 2023",4,"This place was a great find in FiDi! I was blown away by the non-traditional dumpling options they had, such as Philly cheesesteak dumpling and French onion soup dumplings. I honestly just ordered a ton of dumpling apps and shared with my table‚Ä¶ delish!!! However my dad ordered a hanger steak that was very tough and said he has had better. That was the only okay dish that we wouldn‚Äôt order again. Everything else we will be going back for 100%. The service, decor and roominess all get an A! Would highly recommend if you are looking for great food and something a little out of the ordinary :)"

Shawn,"Dined on April 1, 2023",5,"We almost listened to the people who said this place was just ok. Probably just a bit pricey for them lol (our bill was about $320 for 3 people.

boobytrappedINvanity,"Dined on March 26, 2023",5,"From the moment you step inside, you are greeted with an energetic, welcoming vibe and impeccable hospitality. The atmosphere is cozy and sophisticated, with a touch of modern urban street sass refined. It all makes for a perfect dining experience.  The food is simply outstanding. Every dish is a work of art, beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. The restaurant is a modern take on a steakhouse with Asian infusion. The food is flavorful, and the cocktails are delectable. All of the staff are very welcoming and hospitable. It all makes for a great dining experience. You should go! You will not regret it."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 24, 2023",2,My waiter was had a very condescending  atitude. He was friendly and he was training a new person. He eventually going to pass on that atitude.  He never checked back on food and was too busy to bring our condiments when asked. I ordered a to go order when I order our meals. The to go order came out before all our meals and sat there cold for duration of our dining experience.  The bill was $490 and the service was $5 something doesn‚Äôt make sense.  It wasn‚Äôt pleasant at all and my guest felt ignored and unappreciated as a customer.

mrsawfullyamazing,"Dined on March 18, 2023",3,"The ambience was nice and the waiter was very friendly. However, I expected more from all of the hype. The food was under seasoned and just tasted like regular basic food. It was overpriced for what I got and I could‚Äôve gotten better at a chain restaurant. If you want to go for Instagram photos then this is your spot, but if you actually want to enjoy amazing food that will transform you, this place isn‚Äôt it."
Jay13,"Dined on March 12, 2023",3,"Place is nice. Food was ok. Service was moderate. Celebrated a birthday, did not receive recognition for the occasion (though it was on our reservation). Drive from out-of-town to see what the hype was about. Not impressed."
MaryR,"Dined on March 12, 2023",5,"The food is wonderful and service truly terrific.  The last time we visited the music was a bit loud, but didn't think they would change the atmosphere just for us.  This time the music was loud as well but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask if it could be lowered - and it was!  Absolutely love Brooklyn Chop House and will continue to visit as often as possible."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 11, 2023",5,Loved the ambiance and music the food was good . I will def  go back

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 8, 2023",2,"A friend had visited the restaurant last year and thought the food was excellent. I decided to celebrate my sister‚Äôs birthday here and we were really excited about the experience. Unfortunately the restaurant did not deliver. The service was great, but we did not enjoy the salmon or sea bass dishes. We first ordered the sea bass, but it was not  cooked well so we ordered the salmon. Our waiter was excellent and we really appreciated him. Not sure I would recommend this location to anyone, but I may give the other location try."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 2, 2023",4,The food was mediocre at this location. The food is fantastic at the 47th Street location.  The vibes and service was great.  I‚Äôm assuming that the chef had a bad day. I will return again to see if this location redeems itself.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 19, 2023",2,"Update: Someone named Christina reached out to me because of my review. She asked me to reach out to her email and I did this past Tuesday. (Feb 28/ today is Mar 5th) Never heard back from herüòÇSome service this place has. Pretty incredible. Anyway, my feelings are even more solidified and judging by Instagram and TikTok followers they agree with my original review, which you can read below:  Waiter rushed us along. Food was not very good at all. We heard amazing things, which is why we chose it but, we won‚Äôt return. We were supposed to come back with my sister and her husband but I told them not to bother."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 19, 2023",4,"Me and my little sis had been looking forward to dining at the Brooklyn chop house for months. I booked a reservation months in advance to celebrate our February birthdays. I requested a half booth in the reservation ‚Äúspecial request ‚Äú section. Our reservation was at 6pm we arrived at 5pm. We were willing to wait to be seated because we were a hour early. One of the hostess decides to seat us early. She puts me and my sis at a small table between two couples. Immediately I request a half booth because it was a cramped space and even my sis who is slender was extremely uncomfortable. The hostess insists that because it‚Äôs only two of us we cannot get a half booth. She informs us that we can wait for the same size table to become available in a different area. She tells us to wait at the bar. At this point I‚Äôm ready to leave and write a scathing review on yelp , the bartender asks us if we would like to speak to the manager. The gracious manager not only seats us promptly but we have one of the best tables in the house. We were sat at a long booth with two tables push together to make one table. The ill mannered hostess kept staring at us but we ignored her and had an amazing meal. We also noticed that the hostess just wanted to be difficult with us for whatever reason because later two couples were seated near us both in half booths. So she lied about the reason why we couldn‚Äôt have one in the first place smh anyways. Our waiter was awesome she gave us top recommendations on what to order. Everything was delicious but the star of the meal was definitely the ginger mashed potatoes which I ordered with sweet and sour chicken. The ginger beef noodles and the short rib bao buns were a close second in rank. They gave us each a slice of red velvet cake to wish us a happy birthday I‚Äôm not a red velvet fan but the cake was tasty as well. The place is expensive but you‚Äôre paying for an experience so it‚Äôs to be expected. I recommend going beware of the weird hostess."
Jamigon,"Dined on February 18, 2023",5,"If I ever find myself in the city again, this is definitely where I'll be coming to eat; I had the NY strip (best steak I've had) along with the cheesesteak dumplings (a must order for appetizers). The service is phenomenal; from the moment I walked in with my fianc√©, we were greeted and accommodated as if we were regulars.  Boukary was our waiter, and I was extremely impressed with his service. He made sure we were well taken care of. Provided suggestions on what sides pair well with the steak I ordered. Biggest plus point= without me telling him, he caught my fianc√© mentioning that it was her birthday and he made sure to bring out a dessert to sing a birthday song. My fianc√© was impressed that I never left the table so she did not expect this surprise, thank you Boukary and staff; I'll be coming back again with my family and friends for sure!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 16, 2023",5,I had a great time at the Brooklyn chop house downtown location. I ordered the lychee martini and my partner ordered the cosmopolitan; both drinks were delicious and a perfect one and done drink. We tried the lamb gyro dumplings for a starter and I give it a 8/10 ! We also ate the strip steak and the fried rice with lobster which melted in your mouth. The music and atmosphere was right on point to go with the food. I will definitely be back !
KimberlyH,"Dined on February 16, 2023",5,We were in NYC for a week and dined at Brooklyn Chop House for dinner twice. The food and service was outstanding. However I gave only 4 stars for value because both drinks and food are a bit overpriced.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 16, 2023",3,Won‚Äôt be coming back. Portions are so small. $90 for about 5 small slices of steak. Service was poor too.

KimberlyH,"Dined on February 14, 2023",5,"Our overall experience was exceptional.  We ordered the peach and lychee frozze‚Äôs and although on the expensive side ($22) they were delicious and would definitely order again. For our appetizer we went with an order of dumplings. For our entrees we ordered the Filet Mignon and Broccoli, the lamb chops and the lobster fried rice. We loved all of it! The portion sizes were very generous and Angel our waiter was very attentive. We will absolutely return when in NYC again."

Kami,"Dined on February 11, 2023",4,"Last night was the 1st time a friend & myself were able to experience Brooklyn Chophouse & have a few things to share. The hostess came off unpleasant & sour upon greeting in the establishment. When coming to eat at any restaurant a customer wants to feel welcomed upon entering, that was the only issue. The lambchops were filling & the Red Velvet frozen drink was amazing. The waiter for my section was extremely welcoming & very gracious, she had suggestions & made sure to follow up with making sure our experience wasn‚Äôt a complete waste, she really made the evening. The dessert cake was the sealed stamp to come back which is always appreciated. Hostess don‚Äôt need to be fired however more properly trained to deal with guests especially when most people are ordering online & don‚Äôt want to dine out as much."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 30, 2023",2,"As a New York, My taste buds are a melting pot however at this specific restaurant the food was bland. I ordered the Colorado Lamb Chops , Crab Fried Rice, Onion Rings, French fries and a few drinks. I couldn‚Äôt tell which was more bland the Lamb Chops or the Crab fried rice. There was no flavor whatsoever. The Crab Fried Rice still had what seemed to be crab shells, the onion rings were soft and the French fries were just awful. The best thing I had was the Tropical Punch. Honestly, this restaurant is not worth a quarter of the hype it gets. I urge you to try something that is worth your hard earned money."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 30, 2023",3,"The service at this establishment was great. Our server Troy, really ensured we had a pleasant experience.

On top of that, we had to sear ourselves after we were told that our table was ready but the hostess disappeared. 2 hours in and we had not even had our appetizers. After our food arrived we just decided to take it to go. Very disappointed with the entire experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 29, 2023",1,Drove 2 hrs . The wait wasn‚Äôt long but I was seated in the middle of the floor I ask to move and got a better table after 15 min in my meal I was asked to move because someone had reservations but I had one as well non the less we moved bc the hosts said the manager would accommodate us with whatever drinks we want .. waiter never came back to the table was left there tried to let the manager and hosts know I was ready to leave no one was a help to me I had to pay the waiter in the middle of the floor while he was serving because I was ready to go never dealt with restaurants without any customer service or people skills will not be going back !

Marc,"Dined on January 22, 2023",5,Troy was the best server I‚Äôve ever encountered. Phenomenal food. Thanks for a great time.
DaimeP,"Dined on January 22, 2023",4,The people who take the plates off the table are very annoying. I was not done with my food and one guy removed my plate with my fork on it. My only suggestion is that you give the customers the option to ask for the dishes to be removed instead of them running over and just taking them.
BridgetU,"Dined on January 20, 2023",5,"The food was so flavorful and the customer service was excellent, from the men at the door to the hostesses as well as everyone else. Our waiter was a young French man named Bakari (although I am pretty sure I only have the first letter correct, sorry) whose recommendations were so helpful. I definitely will return."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 19, 2023",5,Everything was perfect

Keys247,"Dined on January 18, 2023",5,"As usually the food was great, service as well. It started to get a little crowded in the area were we seated so towards the end of our experience there was a bit of a wait. Overall I enjoyed the ambiance, service and food. My only complaint is I don‚Äôt believe our drinks were worth $19 ea. Even with that being said, I can‚Äôt wait to return."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 16, 2023",5,"I had an exceptional first time and will be returning. The staff was friendly and outgoing from the start upon entry and even before I arrived (as I had to adjust my arrival time)  My waiter Khalil (sp?) was great with suggestions and ensuring my time and money were well spent.  Overall, 10/10! I will be back (need cheat code for parking, tho!)"
Tanisha,"Dined on January 15, 2023",5,Good food. Good skinfolk environment. My only critique is no coat check. Looking forward to going to the other location as well.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 15, 2023",1,"We had a horrible experience. Our server was very rude and dismissive, he rushed us to order, and showed little to no care or attention while we were there. The food was just ok. The drinks were good, but unfortunately since we had less than accommodating service and our waiter hardly checked on us, we only had two."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 15, 2023",4,"My husband and I decided to go on a date & we chose BK Chop House since I have been wanting to go for some time now. Upon our arrival we were seated within 5 minutes, which was very shocking since there is sometimes a wait even with reservations at other restaurants in New York City. The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing, the service was amazing, and the vibe was amazing! On the downside, I gave it 4 stars because we were seated in the middle of an aisle and guests/staff constantly hit our arms as they passed by."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 15, 2023",5,"Wonderful. Food was amazing, staff were amazing. We will certainly be returning"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 15, 2023",5,Good but waiter was a little rushing us and not a tentative

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 11, 2023",4,"We arrived late and they were accommodating. It was a bout 10pm and it seemed like there was only one server so it was kind of slow. But, the food was amazing!"
SimoneW,"Dined on January 7, 2023",3,What I order my steak was burn and fatty I choose the best steak but it wasn‚Äôt  other than that it was ok I was recommended by a friend who really enjoy the food there but hey to each of our own

Omazing,"Dined on January 6, 2023",4,Food was really good and the wait was minimal. Staff A1
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 4, 2023",3,"While the food was amazing, the service by our waitress in particular was dreadful. From the moment we sat down, it seemed like she was annoyed at us for being there. It took forever to get her back to the table when we wanted to order another course or another drink. The restaurant was not very busy and we would look over and see her just standing there multiple times. She almost never checked in with us and when she did it felt like she was still annoyed to be there. At one point, she spilled almost half of my drink on the table and myself when putting it down. I understand that things happen, however on top of everything else it was frustrating. At the end of the meal it took forever to just get the check. We left a tip, however I almost wish I had not since due to the delay we missed our train and had to either wait an hour and a half for the next one or pay for a $50 Uber.  I would like to note that the rest of these staff was very attentive and gave excellent service."
Fatima,"Dined on January 4, 2023",5,The food was excellent and the mixed drinks hit the spot. I had an out of this world ribeye and the chicken and lobster satays are an absolute must!
Chauntis,"Dined on January 2, 2023",4,"It was just an ok experience for a birthday dinner. Server kept disappearing which took us a while to order another round of drinks. Left a note on the reservation that it was a birthday, i guess the message wasnt relayed to the server because the dessert came out without candle."
Armani,"Dined on January 2, 2023",3,"Food is over rated and expensive the server was very attentive and good  . The food doesn‚Äôt have much seasoning, if your looking for flavor you have to apply some type of sauce ( we ordered lamb chops,steak,shrimp fried rice and hamburger dumplings) . The tropical punch drink was advertised as frozen , but it was just thick and kinda cold. But was flavorful .  The complimentary birthday red velvet is bland but it‚Äôs a nice touch . The ambiance and workers were great .The bathroom had no changing table for babies but they did have a regular side table outside the stall ."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 1, 2023",5,It was a great night
JamesT,"Dined on December 29, 2022",5,"The ambiance, food, and service makes its a 5 star experience. If it was local to our residence we would dine  there weekly. Hopefully there is a NJ opening in the future!"
NatW,"Dined on December 29, 2022",5,"From beginning to end, it was a wonderful experience. The cocktails and food were delicious and the Playlist was on point, as was the service! I've been there several times and plan to continue going."

LashawnA,"Dined on December 26, 2022",4,Went on a solo outing. Ordered the lamb chops medium with the broccoli and mash potatoes. To drink I had the sour diesel at first I was disappointed with the drink size but after 10 mins it was more than enough. I recorded the food but OpenTable doesn‚Äôt allow videos

ScottD,"Dined on December 25, 2022",3,"I was a bit disappointed. I came for the dry aged steak-- which was good... but not great.  Drinks were good. Service was acceptable. But for the money, there are other places with a better overall experience."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 24, 2022",5,Great and food was excellent and I would recommend it to friends
LadiAllure,"Dined on December 24, 2022",4,"I‚Äôve been here a few times and love it. I usually don‚Äôt have any complaints but after dining last night, I have one. The seating area behind the bar should be changed. It was very uncomfortable for me when people were passing by, standing by the bar to sit and bumping into my chair. Several times I was bumped which annoyed me. That‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs my only complaint"
aura,"Dined on December 22, 2022",4,"Nice ambiance, Ariel was great at the bar. Food is okay. Must remember to order Peking duck an hour ahead. Great get together spot."
MorganMM,"Dined on December 21, 2022",1,This was not a great dining experience. If you‚Äôre used to anything  above a 5 dining experience you will be disappointed.  It was a birthday which they failed to even communicate to the waitress. By the time we finished eating - the service and food were so disappointing we didn‚Äôt even mention it.  1. Waitress was rude and had to be flagged over by the manager to take our second drink order 15-20 mins after our first drink was finished. The manager who was at the bar talking to friends for the entire duration of our dining experience.  2.  The food was sub par - the lobster was soggy and overcooked and the waitress had trouble describing how it was prepared and rolled her eyes when we asked for clarification. For a $200 entre the waitstaff should know how to describe it.  3. Bathrooms were a mess. Hostess was in there on her phone taking up the only free stall.  If you‚Äôre looking to celebrate a birthday or special occasion do it somewhere else. Plenty of other nice steakhouses in New York that will accommodate you with good food and great service. This place won‚Äôt be here for much longer.
QuincyJ,"Dined on December 20, 2022",5,"The food was great, & the environment was great. It‚Äôs definitely a little hard to find parking."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 19, 2022",4,The drinks were really bad. We tried several different ones.  The food was good. Service was great!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 18, 2022",5,"Everything was wonderful. Although we arrived late due to the NYC traffic (of course) but the staff was very accommodating because I was in communication with my arrival time. BUT that food!!! It was magnificent!!!!!! Order the ginger beef noodles, lobster wonton, crab fried rice and Filet mignon beef with broccoli. Everything was cook to PERFECTION! The beef was so tender it was like butter. Lol"
Julia,"Dined on December 18, 2022",4,"The menu was very interesting.   We enjoyed two appetizers - wonton soup and lamb gyro dumplings which were delicious !  We then shared pork buns, tacos and chicken lettuce wraps.   The lycee martinis were very good.  For dessert my husband had the ice cream sundae and I had the apple wontons.   All food was very flavorful and well prepared.    Our server, Troy, was professional, and attentive. Definitely a place we would repeat!"
Norinne,"Dined on December 18, 2022",5,"The atmosphere was cozy, The service outstanding.  There was  a fabulous variety of food choices. We were a party of 6 and were all commenting on how delicious our meals were, along with the generous portions. Drinks were also generous and delicious. Well worth the visit and cost.  Strongly recommend the Brooklyn Chop House."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 16, 2022",2,"The waiter took my order incorrectly.  The whole experience went downhill from that point.  I left and gave the leftovers to stray dogs and the cylindrical porcelain god.  I should have been given a real apology and an invitation from a manager to visit and dine on Brooklyn Chop House gratis, but no such fortunes."
DanaB,"Dined on December 15, 2022",4,"The greeter was awesome, loved the atmosphere, decor, music and the food was nice.  Our waiter not do great, overall he may have been having a bad day, but when all else fails, FAKE it!!"

AdrianneH,"Dined on December 10, 2022",3,Food and ambience was good. However crowd was just ok. Couple by my table had an argument. Almost had a physical fight. Not sure if it was to get out of paying the bill.
JanellB,"Dined on December 5, 2022",5,"It was our first time at Brooklyn Chop House (downtown), We celebrated my Husband birthday . The food was delicious! The drinks was very good especially the tropical punch frozen , I even ordered two of them. The only thing was the waiting time. Our reservation was for 8:30pm we arrived at 8:20 pm and we understand we was early , so we had to sit at the bar until a table was available for us. We waited until 8:45 and the host called us to the table where was being seated, as we get to the table we had to wait again because the party had just left and the table wasn‚Äôt cleaned yet. So we had to sit again at a table that was ready  and cleaned , while our table was being cleaned (if that make sense). Also i booked my reservation online and informing it was a birthday for the occasion and our waiter didn‚Äôt sing happy birthday or brought a slice of cake. I don‚Äôt kno if i was supposed to let the waiter know , but I thought the reason for asking online while booking an reservation was to give a heads up.Otherwise the atmosphere was beautiful , food was GRADE A EXCELLENT! Would definitely go back.  Janell"

CherB46,"Dined on November 12, 2022",3,There is no waiting area for guess.. so you just have to stand in the front of the restaurant until  your table is ready unless you go to the bar you‚Äôre offered flat or sparkling water then charged $10 for the water unless you ask for tap the waiter took our orders and we didn‚Äôt see him again until I had to flag him down to get the check‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a cute ambience but the service is trash

When taken to next table. our food went missing.we had to reorder and pay for it too. through this time ;  the door Matrin -decided she would keep telling us by 6:15 we must leave for there next reservation. The waitor seem to busy to attend to our table. often dismising us when try to place order.  He even brought out the wrong cake for our evening. when the cake box had reservation name on it.

AmaB,"Dined on October 31, 2022",5,"The food was absolutely DELICIOUS! We had the Philly cheesesteak dumpling for appetizer, bone in ribeye, and side of broccoli, with hot fudge sundae for dessert. The dumpling was very good. My partner advised it was the best steak he's had and he's such a meat/steak guy so that coming from him is a wow factor. The broccoli was also very good, nice and firm with an great garlic flavor so yummy. The ribeye was a bit on the pricey side, the most we ever spent on steak ($110 for 24 oz bone in ribeye) and I wished the hot fudge sundae was with chocolate hot fudge instead of caramel. Nonetheless, everything was delicious."

JohnnyF,"Dined on October 26, 2022",1,"First time here.   Food was overpriced and overrated. Service was underwhelming and apathetic.   Ambiance was great. So was the music.

The only semi-downside is that the food is overpriced; I imagine that's due to the location and we were happy to pay the premium to support a Black-owned business so overall, I'd return"
YeseniaD,"Dined on September 28, 2022",5,Love Brooklyn chop house it‚Äôs the best place for date night or girls night
JiggaJT23,"Dined on September 28, 2022",5,Don Pooh & Stratis are the New York Goats üêê of Restaurantuers  I had the Tomohawk which was amazing ill be back soon
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 28, 2022",5,"It was our anniversary and the staff really take care of us. All staff really friendly, server recommendations was excellent, shrimp tempura and the filet mignon was delicious. Thank you for making our dinner special."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 27, 2022",5,"The food was great as always! The drinks were good & strong. The service was amazing, everything came out quick & efficiently."
Mallek,"Dined on September 25, 2022",5,"The food and the service was great. We ordered a few drinks, appetizers and some entrees. Everything was exceptional. It was a bday celebration and they included a slice of cheescake with a big sparkle on top. We are planning on going again."
LaurenL,"Dined on September 25, 2022",3,"The service was excellent, the food was okay. Overall I think this place is a bit overrated and there are better options in the city to enjoy."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 25, 2022",4,Top notch. Will return!
GoodFoodGoodTimes,"Dined on September 25, 2022",1,The ambience and service felt like a NYC steakhouse and the prices were definitely of a high end steakhouse however the food was anything but. The steaks and the lobster were not good and they breaded them which made it worse. The food reminded me of a Chinese restaurant. Even the sides of pork fried rice and bok choy. Definitely not worth the money.
ewill2002,"Dined on September 24, 2022",5,"Incredible!  That‚Äôs why we came back.  We were last here March 2022.  This trip to New York, we Booked the same nearby Hotel (The Beekman) 1.5 blocks away.  We had Dinner Friday night and invited a relative to join us on Saturday night just so we could have an excuse to dine there again.  It‚Äôs that good."

AladonnaB,"Dined on September 20, 2022",5,The vibes were nice and siren and the staff were professonal as well as welcoming. I enjoyed my birthday dinner. The food was a 10/10
ArnoldL,"Dined on September 19, 2022",2,"Waaaaaayyyuy overpriced.   Steak prices are higher than all the real steakhouses (ie the ones that don‚Äôt double as an overpriced Chinese restaurant), but the quality of food and service falls far short of that of a real steakhouse.   The waiter was nice enough, but when my female friend got his attention and asked for a glass of wine or dessert, he took her order and was in his way without even asking me whether I wanted anything to drink or for dessert.  It was a little bizarre.   Bottom line is that it is not close to being in the same class as a real steakhouse and it should be much cheaper until it earns its stripes."
GodeliahW,"Dined on September 18, 2022",5,Disappointed that the tables were so small especially after confirmation on the phone that we would had a 4 person table my husband a ball player two seat table plus all the appetizers no room to really enjoy comfortable
MelissaD,"Dined on September 18, 2022",3,Ordered 3 different kinds of dumplings - not great and definitely not worth $18/plate. Porterhouse steak and 7lb Peking duck were very good. Sides of bacon and broccoli were average. Dessert - red velvet cake and ice cream sampler were good; nothing mind-blowing. Overall decent food but nothing special so would not return.
NasheS,"Dined on September 17, 2022",5,"The lobster was overcooked,  server was overwhelmed and still it was an enjoyable birthday dinner."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 17, 2022",5,"Excellent food and service, Alex served us and was extremely helpful."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 16, 2022",2,"The food has always been excellent. But the wait staff have been very overbearing. My date and I had just been seated and the waiter(Alex) kept pestering us to hurry up and pick something from the menu before we could even decide for ourselves. Then after we picked the chicken and lobster salad (which are huge, no complaints) told us we needed to pick something else because the department of health had been watching the restaurant.. weird. There was a busboy who was watching our table like a hawk. And would rush over to get our plates before we could properly finish our meal. It made her feel uncomfortable so we left without getting dessert. Now she doesn‚Äôt want to return. Please speak with them because I love to support black owned businesses. But not to the extent of feeling harassed."

Jamrocker,"Dined on September 12, 2022",4,Great food and service with great food suggestions. It always great to see beautiful people of color  dine out!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 12, 2022",3,I frequently visit Brooklyn Chophouse and usually the service is superb but today the server. Marin A. was horrible to my mother and I. It was my mother‚Äôs birthday and he was rude and dismissive . He had an attitude when we asked for something and never checked on our table. Then he brought her birthday cake and walked away. Not once did Marin say happy birthday or gather his colleagues to sing happy birthday. It was my mom‚Äôs first time there and she said based on the service she doesn‚Äôt wanna come back.
MichelleC,"Dined on September 11, 2022",3,the pork chops I ordered were dry and had a bad aftertaste.  the drinks took awhile to come to our table after being able to quickly sit down outsids. the dumplings were too salty to even take a bite. overall the price of what we ordered wasn't up to par with the quality we were expecting to eat..

BELLE,"Dined on August 26, 2022",3,"1st the host was so pleasant! Service and food were good. Loved the ambiance. However, I understand everything when up price wise and demands are higher; but if you gonna charge $35 for lobster fried rice and $32 for lobster wonton at least make sure I can taste the damn lobster. don‚Äôt get me wrong, the flavor was there in every bite, delicious but too overpriced when you not getting what you are paying for."
ruthiea,"Dined on August 25, 2022",4,I arrived on time for my reservation. Staff and service was great. For starters we had Philly cheesesteak dumplings and salt and pepper lobster Wontons I give it 7/10.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 20, 2022",2,"The section that we sat in was really nice and semi private. Our waiter was really good. She recommended a drink that was really good. She was very knowledgeable about the food. It was a large party; 7ppl and she was very tentative. The wait was not long; My reservations was for 9pm and by time we sat it was around 9:30pm. Because they close at 11 they had to bring everything out at once which wasn‚Äôt an issue for me. The music was good. However, so far 3 people out of 7 became sick from the food, which is why I decided to give 3 stars instead of 5."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 18, 2022",5,"My experience was great at the Brooklyn Chop House. I dined for dinner with a group of friends celebrating a birthday. We had an amazing time. The food was delicious, and the server as well as the front desk was very accommodating. I had a friend running late but asked for champagne toasts ready at the table when we all arrived. We were still able to get seated before our last guest arrived, which I greatly appreciated being that the champagne was already at the table. Overall, my best friend had an amazing birthday dinner and I‚Äôm happy I selected this location to help celebrate."

MauriceR,"Dined on August 3, 2022",4,I go to steak houses often. The food here is good but overpriced compared to the competition. Service is not a strong point. I was left waiting for refills on cocktails for long periods of time. There are many better options in New York.

Once inside the hostess welcomed us and congratulated us for our anniversary. She also asked where would we like to sit and accommodated our wishes. Then the waiter came and welcomed/introduced himself nicely. The food was served and everything tasted great! No complaints, great service and great food! Lastly our waiter surprised us with a delicious slice of cheesecake with a sparkling candle and wished us a Happy Anniversary! Such A Wonderful Experience At The Brooklyn Chop House"

James,"Dined on June 21, 2022",3,"The service was neither prompt nor attentive. It was our anniversary, which I noted when making the reservation, but that wasn‚Äôt acknowledged, despite other couples‚Äô being recognized for their anniversaries. One of our side dishes was cold, and no one offered to refill our drinks. For the price, the service better be spot on, and this wasn‚Äôt."
TracyB,"Dined on June 21, 2022",3,The food didn‚Äôt stand up to all the hype of the name and it wasn‚Äôt worth the price I have had better steak at a less expensive price at Shula steakhouse in Miami and Wolfe Gang Pucks steakhouse in time square and Peter lugas in Long Island the steak  Your steak here was tasteless and the appetizers weren‚Äôt good we ate the food but I don‚Äôt think it was worth 500 dollars for 3 ppl

QuintinS,"Dined on May 22, 2022",2,"Best part of the meal was the red velvet cake , the lobster dumplings and the salad. Smallest tomahawk steak I‚Äôve ever had. Steak was cooked correctly but i expected a better quality cut of meat for the price.   Staff and Waiter were both excellent."

MinervaR,"Dined on May 12, 2022",1,"To be honest, I'm so disappointed that I have to give this poor review. I took my husband for his Bday yesterday.  The food was oily and bland,  Lamb dumplings crab fried rice and the steak. The drinks were also overprised. I  Was expecting for them to have a good mixologist. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 11, 2022",5,"Took my wifey out for Mother‚Äôs Day and the food was amazing!

RonaldoD,"Dined on May 7, 2022",1,The food was a big disappointment for the price I paid I felt like the food could of tasted 10x better it taste like they didn‚Äôt season the food at all. The food had zero flavor. Also I put it was my girlfriend birthday on the recommendation and nobody came to sing happy birthday my experience at chop house was completely awful.

SaidahB,"Dined on May 1, 2022",1,"Wish I could give no stars. Sat down and did not receive service for almost an hour. They were clearly short staffed, but it was a nightmare from the beginning. Had a 9:30 reservation, arrived on time and was waiting for a table forever. Needless to say, I will not be returning here again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 1, 2022",4,Customer service is outstanding. The food was delicious. The drinks were amazing. Had a good experience. My inky complain would be the seats. It was a table for two but the table was very small. Not enough room for big tall people. Other than that everything was good. Definitely will return.
DarionC,"Dined on May 1, 2022",5,"First time here and we had a blast! Celebrated a birthday. The food was great, the drinks were even better! The bill was under $300, very affordable for 2 people. Customer service was literally amazing. Kiana was our waitress and she went above and beyond for us! Overall it was a fantastic dinner. I‚Äôd recommend B.C.H. And I‚Äôll definitely be coming back soon!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 1, 2022",1,"Horrible dining experience. Waiter/Service was horrible, food overpriced and not appetizing. Would not recommend or ever dine there again."
RoshandaH,"Dined on April 30, 2022",5,Worth the trip all the way from Florida. The crab fried rice was the best ever and drinks were sooo well mixed had to order two to see if I could watch the bartender technique. Vibes were nice and definitely will be back
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 30, 2022",5,It was great for my birthday experience
Johnny,"Dined on April 29, 2022",3,"The place is very pretty and nice.  Maybe they were just off last night, but we ordered a few things and one of them never showed up by the end of the meal, and when we asked about it, we were told by the manager ""we don't have that tonight"", but the waiter did not know that, so we just waited for nothing.  We had to ask for another glass of wine twice as they forgot.  We ordered ice cream for dessert, and then they came back later to tell us they don't have ice cream that night either, so we waiting for nothing again. Expensive place for what it is, but worth going if you patience for a few things."
RayJ,"Dined on April 29, 2022",3,"We ordered two steaks and a few dishes to share. The steaks were very good; however, the lobster satay was overcooked and the sea bass was fairly average. Part of the order came out incorrectly, but this was quickly remedied. Drinks were also average for the price"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 29, 2022",5,Lychee Frose absolutely delicious ! Steak made to specification!! Excellent service and Great meal! Everyone had an amazing time!
elig,"Dined on April 29, 2022",3,"This relatively new establishment is on its way to being a very excellent place to dine in the downtown area. But as of today the food is barely adequate when compared to the level that the restaurant is catering. The problem is that the food is mediocre. I had some basic dishes that sounded rather interesting, like the cheeseburger and pastrami dumplings, avoid them. The  wonton soup was OK but nothing special. The chicken lettuce wrap, standard in many places, was mediocre, even PF Chang beats it big-time. We had many main dishes, like the short rib, the fish, and the steak. All are a mistake, when compared to what this place is supposed to deliver. . . But I do feel long-term that they will get it right and be a far more tasty as well as elegant restaurant in the Lower Downtown area."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 28, 2022",5,Ariel (our bartender) and Lilly were BOTH amazing! The food~delicious!!!
winwithbernice,"Dined on April 28, 2022",5,"I celebrated my birthday here with my family and all 8 of us said 10 out of 10. First of all it‚Äôs a VIBE so show out dress up and show out! Second of all the service is top tier. Shout out to the staff. Shout out to Angel. They make you feel like you are spending millions with them. They literally wait on you you don‚Äôt have to ask they catch your vibe and they rock with you. I love it here and they were short staffed and still made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant and they never skipped a beat. TOP TIER!!! The drinks are strong but you don‚Äôt know it until you finish it and you leaning. The food was so good we didn‚Äôt eat it all because when I say somebody Black auntie with the seasoning is in the back chef-in it up! We are Haitian and we love seasoned food and even my Haitian mother was going off. This food is ABSOLUTELY amazing and fresh. IYKYK The flavor combos and the dish inspirations. Muah *Chef‚Äôs kiss* I ate a portion of my food purposely saving it to go home and demolish it which I did. Amazing time, amazing staff, amazing food, vibes all that.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 21, 2022",1,The food was disgusting. A $110 steak that was covered in more butter than anyone should even consume in a year let alone one night.
ShanaiB,"Dined on April 21, 2022",5,"At this point, put a cot in the back of the building and I'd live here. I love the food and the service here. The staff is very gracious, I tell everyone I know to come to the Brooklyn Chophouse"

Suave,"Dined on April 16, 2022",2,"So my party arrived on time for our reservation for my birthday but waited 40mins just to be seated. Finally after being seated, we ordered our food, everyone‚Äôs food came except for mine! Nobody came to check on us to see how the food was. My party finished eating and I still did not get what I ordered so had to cancel my order. They tried to offer me free dessert and shots but I refused since that can‚Äôt make up for me not eating. I came to experience the cuisine as well as the drinks. I have no plans on ever returning to this restaurant as this was not the experience I expected."

Sarah,"Dined on April 9, 2022",4,Low key spot. Food is tasty. Drinks are excellent. Location is just ok. Service was neutral more on the good side.
BritA,"Dined on April 7, 2022",1,I went to the original location because the new location in Times Square was closed to the public due to a private event. Me and my fianc√© was not satisfied with our dinner. The Philly cheese steak dumplings dough was extremely thick and under cooked. Leaving a doughy texture that was very unpleasant.
Disappointing,"Dined on April 4, 2022",2,"5 Star prices, 2 star service.  Examples.  Forced to order entire meal at once, wouldn't take app order without whole meal.  Trouble opening wine and then didn't offer taste prior to pouring.  Asked for fresh pepper for salad and brought a dish with a pile of regular ground pepper which we used with our fingers, no pepper grinder.   Seemed like a place trying to be a 5 Star steakhouse that does not know how to do that.  $470 meal for Salad, Filet, mashed potatoes and a bottle of wine that would be $50 at any wine shop was $150.  If you're going to charge those prices your service should be up to the task."
JudyL,"Dined on April 3, 2022",1,Food was very over priced for the quality. Steak was not Prime Cut and Fish was bland.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 2, 2022",5,"The food was good. The waiter was amazing. Very attentive, nice, and knowledgeable about food and everything in the restaurant. I will be back soon."
kennishae,"Dined on April 1, 2022",5,My friends and I visted this lovely restaurant and i must say i have zero complaints. I made reservations for 8:30 pm and i was seated right away.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 31, 2022",5,Amazing food!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 28, 2022",3,"It‚Äôs an experience to experience really. It‚Äôs very tight, like extremely snug, so be mindful of that. The food is basic to say the least for the big price tag . You have to order your sides separately from your main course and the menu is very confusing and incomplete."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 27, 2022",4,The food here was amazing ! The lamb chops melted right in your mouth. I cannot wait to go back to NY and eat here again
AllyC,"Dined on March 27, 2022",1,"Service was horrible. Food was not what we expected. It took them a while to figure out who was waiting on our table,  there was no menu,  took them a long time to even take our order. Waitress Cassandra C, took our order, and we served the incorrect order. Then she never returned.  There was another waitress, who had to check on our appetizers and realized our order was never put in. Food was mediocre at best. Best thing was the appetizers. Having great service helps build a better environment and it felt we were being overlooked all night.  It was smaller inside than expected and very crowded.  I would not recommend anyone to eat at this restaurant. They need to improve in service."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 14, 2022",3,I was expecting something a little more upscale and comfortable. The food was ok but for the prices I expected better. This is not a traditional steak house. It was just ok. Service was good and the staff was friendly.

RobinS,"Dined on March 13, 2022",5,"Brooklyn Chophouse offered everything my wife and I needed for our first anniversary. Food, ambience, music, everything A+! The lamb dumplings were amazing and we‚Äôve been wanting to try sea bass and decided Brooklyn Chophouse would be the first place. Amazing! I will now be ordering sea bass wherever I go. 15/10, we will definitely be back"
Porsche,"Dined on March 13, 2022",4,Not our favorite. Good but overpriced and ranged from excellent to mediocre. Service was just okay. Lots of new people and our server forgot to take one of our guests order so we had to chase them down. Upsell of water. No rolls or bread offered.  And wicked loud. Great funky tunes but so loud we asked twice to turn it down and the waiter grew angry himself at front of house because he could not hear orders at all. Third time the music lowered to an acceptable level but steadily crept back up. Some food like ribs and surf and turf was great lobster dumplings doughy and unappealing. Garlic mashed with ginger outstanding by. Will not return.

Bday,"Dined on February 21, 2022",5,"I dined here over the weekend with my griflriends, for the first time for my birthday. I picked this place based on its rave reviews and I was not disappointed. The ambiance was warm and inviting, a perfect place for any occasion. The service was great! The drinks kept flowing and it didn't take long for my food to come.   The food was so good! I'm a pescatarian so I had seafood dumplings, impossible burger dumplings, shrimp, veggie fried rice, and rich red velvet cake, all of it was delicious. My meat eater friends liked their dishes and ordered some food to go. It's pricey $$$, but they really feed you so I can't complain.   I would highly recommend this place. I'm definitely going back. I can't wait for them to open their 2nd place in Times Square in December."

ShalaynaS,"Dined on February 20, 2022",1,"Love this place. One of my fave restaurants but we had reservations and when we got to the restaurant, there was a wait list for reservations and was told there were 6 people ahead of us waiting to be seated and the hostess refused to tell us an estimated time for when we were to be seated. So we went to Buddakan instead and after getting to the other restaurant waiting a few mins and being seated, getting our appetizers, I got a text saying our table was ready.  I was disappointed because I was soooooo ready to eat good, get tipsy and feel the vibes."
KylaS,"Dined on February 20, 2022",4,The food was good but it wasn‚Äôt worth the money. Overrated. If you don‚Äôt mind spending the money for something you can get cheaper then go.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 20, 2022",3,The food was really good but the only problem I had with this place is even with a reservation my wait was still an hour and that sucked. It was really cold that evening having to wait with a reservations hurts the experience
ShuntelM,"Dined on February 20, 2022",4,The food is always amazing. The wait time was ridiculous especially after making a reservation
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 20, 2022",4,The ambience was awesome the food was just OK.But that rice OMG was delicious
Anonymous,"Dined on February 20, 2022",3,"Not for me.  Atmosphere is great, but food, service, and overall quality is just not bad but below average for this price point."
RichardPhelps,"Dined on February 20, 2022",5,"My lady and I had an amazing time. Our waiter was extremely kind and courteous.  He was very professional, and the food was very delicious. The vibe of the restaurant was lovely. I would recommend BKLNY Chop house to anyone."

Pao1013,"Dined on February 20, 2022",5,10/10 Amazing ! We decided to go with many small plates and everything we had was delicious. Drinks were strong and tasty. The staff  made us feel like we were at home. The best !
AliciaH,"Dined on February 19, 2022",4,Food was great. Pricing was a lil high. Service wasn‚Äôt the best waiter took our order then had to keep getting his attention if we needed something. The bus boy was more attentive than the waiter.   Made reservations for 8 but didn‚Äôt get seated until hour or so later. What is the point of making a reservation?
Loveadeal2019,"Dined on February 19, 2022",4,"This was my first time visiting Brooklyn Chop House and I really enjoyed the restaurant experience.  I made reservations, but I still had to wait over 20 minutes for a table. Besides that. the food was awesome, the service was great, and the music was on point.  The ambiance of the restaurant makes it a wonderful place for celebrations.  I'm looking forward to visiting Brooklyn Chop House again."

Cali,"Dined on February 16, 2022",4,"I always love this place because of their ambiance & fast service. The first time, our food was impeccable. This time, it was okay. The calamari was really salty and the steak was not the best that I‚Äôve had but still good. We did have a really good time however. Will be back in the future."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 16, 2022",2,"Ordered crab soup dumplings and PASTRAMI dumplings for appetizer.  The crab dumplings was one hour away from smelling bad, but the  taste told the story.  The crab meat was spoiled and not fresh at all.  The little bits of pastrami in the pastrami dumplings was worse.  It consisted of hard gristle pieces.  For main course we ordered the surf and turf , with the crispy lobster.   We also ordered lobster fried rice.  What we got was the ginger garlic lobster and not the fried lobster.  The ginger lobster was also spoiled,  it had an underlying ammonia smell.  You could not smell it right away due to the ginger and garlic but once we got the left overs home that ammonia smell was definite .  The lobster fried rice has literally one piece of lobster.  With all of this,  I finally spoke up.  The manger was very kind and offered what she could to remedy the situation. She also offered to  change the fried rice which we accepted, only to see that the waitress charged us for two lobster fried rice.  I don‚Äôt mind paying for what I ate or ordered but , we did not get two fried rice.  This was my second visit and this visit was sub-par."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 13, 2022",1,"I didn‚Äôt have the best experience, the steak was too salty but the mashed potatoes were good. Also our server kept the rest of my change without asking me if the rest of it was for her, I had to ask her to bring me my change back. I will NOT be returning."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 9, 2022",5,BEST DUMPLINGS AND SERVICE I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME.  THEAE GUYS REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 9, 2022",2,"The service, including the hostess that seated my father and myself was good. I ordered the California lobster avocado salad, lobster ‚ÄúSpring Roll‚Äù dumplings, lamb chops and garlic mashed potatoes. My dad had the rib eye. I enjoyed eating the salad, lamb chops and potatoes. The dumplings, however, were horrible and had no lobster filling, which I mentioned to the waiter hoping there was an error. The waiter in response attempted to assure me and stated that there was lobster in the dumpling but it‚Äôs heavily seasoned. There was no lobster; just seasoning. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to the lobster dumplings; my dad only tried one and refused to eat anymore since we were served essentially seasoned dough. I also did not like the presentation of the mashed potatoes in a metal bucket but that‚Äôs just my opinion. Overall my experience was good with the exception of the dumplings."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 7, 2022",2,"While the service was relatively fast, my steak,  which I asked for medium-rare, was more akin to well done, likely in part due to the cooking, but also due to the skillet it remained on, which isn't typical in a restaurant with the cost of this menu. I would have sent the food back, but they crammed so many seats into the place that I ate the cost of it to expedite my trip.  Restaurant was not worth the cost."
KyleW,"Dined on February 7, 2022",5,We had a great experience and look forward to dining here again!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2022",3,"Eclectic menu, decent drinks. Half steakhouse, half pan-Asian. Well prepared steak, tasty bok choy and duck taco appetizer. Service did not live up to the quality or price of the food. Wine list mediocre at best. Key point: take the plastic off the plates and cutlery!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2022",5,"It was amazing! I loved the food, drinks and atmosphere."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 23, 2022",5,Me and my boyfriend came here Saturday 1/22 and the food was FANTASTIC the drinks was EXCELLENT and our steaks was sooooo tender is was like cutting butter and melt in your mouth. The only thing i didn‚Äôt like was that i made reservations for 9:15 and we didn‚Äôt get seated until 10:30 ish but it was definitely worth the wait.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 23, 2022",2,Food was very over priced $100 Ny Strip asked for it medium well it came out like a brick apps were okay over all very very mediocre food for high price wouldn‚Äôt recommend

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 23, 2022",3,"Waitstaff was kind but overall don‚Äôt seem like they are trained very well. I didn‚Äôt feel like I was taken care of in proportion to the amount of $ we were spending. The GM was kind and personable, he came over just to check on our table. Steak was great. Other foods were pretty good. A lot of options. I would go back, but with much lower expectations on service."

David,"Dined on January 18, 2022",3,"Beautiful restaurant!  Great vibe! The dumplings were amazing. The rest of the experience wasn't so great.  I ordered the surf and turf (first mistake), shouldn't have ordered steak from a fusion restaurant but figured with the prices being so high it would be great.  It wasn't.  The lobster and steak came out luke warm, but it was seasoned pretty good.  The sides also came out warm and not hot.  The food wasn't horrible, just not hot.  The service wasn't anything to rave about either. It was empty, yet our server took forever to check on us and spent half the time talking to co workers.  I expected a better experience based on the prices but was left disappointed."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 17, 2022",5,A little pricey but overall worth it for the food ambiance and great service 10/10

BWest,"Dined on January 15, 2022",5,"The food was greatttt, I ordered the filet mignon and broccoli with a side of lobster fried rice. My only problem is that the filet mignon came out a little cold but the whole experience outweighed that . It is a very intimate restaurant with low lighting great music and the drinks was amazing as well I had the sour diesel"
NicoleP,"Dined on January 15, 2022",5,the wait times for a table is insane especially when you reserved but everything else is good and perfect vibes
XGermain,"Dined on January 15, 2022",5,"Excellent experience, perfect atmosphere and top notch service. Highly recommend the filet and house-crafted sauce, it‚Äôs the best in the city and not to be missed when dining here."
Katherine,"Dined on January 15, 2022",5,"We came here for my birthday NY trip and it was so worth the price. The ambience and music playlist has the perfect date night vibe. The food came out quickly and was delicious - we ate every bite. The service was unlike anything I‚Äôve experienced as they had auxiliary waiters close by that were ready to pick up anything you drop, take away empty dishes, and/or bring you anything you need. We will definitely be back next time we‚Äôre in NY."
TiffanyC,"Dined on January 15, 2022",5,The food was excellent and the service was fast and friendly. The food was hot and fresh. Drinks were also great. Dessert was also delicious.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 11, 2022",5,The food was really good. I had ribs which are good. the salmon was also good and flavorful. I just felt the chicken fried rice had no taste. We didn‚Äôt get to have dessert because they were out of what we wanted but an overall great experience.
CourtneyW,"Dined on January 11, 2022",5,I made a reservation and I was seated right away. It wasn‚Äôt crowded which was a plus for me. Staff were very attentive. Overall I had a great experience.
DanielleS,"Dined on January 10, 2022",5,We thoroughly enjoyed our evening. It was my boyfriends birthday and the manager and my server were very accommodating without me having to say or do much in regards to dessert and just a simple ‚Äúhappy birthday!‚Äù Making our evening very pleasant and special. The entrees were sooo good! Meat was so tender. I got the braised short ribs. The drinks were very good as well. Delightful experience. Will be back!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 10, 2022",4,"Fat on the rib eye was more than I expected. I guess that‚Äôs due to the actual steak cut. Other than that, all was well"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 10, 2022",1,"After I convinced my date to take an hour drive on a rainy Sunday evening, We were seated 45 later than our reservation time. Already a bad start but we figured the food would make up for that Indiscretion,  We were sat at a very tiny table which we literally had to squeeze our arms in at the table to compensate for servers and patrons. We ordered 2 appetizers each that could  barely fit on the table, which prompted me to ask for a bigger table since I saw couples that came after us that didn‚Äôt have any reservation was seated at. But by the time the moving was concluded the mushroom soup we ordered was cold along with the three other appetizers. They sat us at the table which is equal to us sitting outside, every time the door opened we were ambushed with gushing freezing air. There are no proper waiting area and apparently reservations were being handled by someone who isn‚Äôt fit to be in that department. Every one that walked through the door somehow made their way next to our table and it was no longer us eating but us and 10 other ppl that was so close next to our table that I think they could see the fruit fly that wouldn‚Äôt leave us alone.  After speaking to the young lady at the front desk (there were 3 of them, the one who wore her tiny leather skirt and her bra straps popping out, that‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm talking about) (bad attitude as well) so I went to her and explained that we are not comfortable eating with very cold air every 2 mins however she seemed more annoyed than we were and said there‚Äôs nothing she could do and as she passed by countless times I don‚Äôt know what was more disturbing, her unpleasant face as she glared at us or the fact she didn‚Äôt want to make eye contact.  A $550.00 check for 2 ppl which would‚Äôve been more only if we were comfortable, nevertheless it wasn‚Äôt worth it!   I get that a business must utilize every square inch of their establishment but when it means having your patrons being cold and uncomfortable, is it really worth it???"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 9, 2022",5,"It was great, however it took 2 hours to get our food. But the food was worth the wait ."
Tikesha,"Dined on January 9, 2022",3,"I truly enjoyed the ambience, however the food was very disappointing. It was just horrible."
irenem,"Dined on January 9, 2022",3,"Overall music selection is great, lighting is good, drinks are delicious especially the lychee froze, food is ok, needs to be a bit more seasoned, but it is really overpriced, space is tight, and there is a wait even with reservations, with no room to enjoy the bar or wait for your seat."
georgiaw,"Dined on January 9, 2022",4,"Say outside, heaters were great and it was much more quiet than inside. Definitely very pricey, and in my opinion a little too pricey for the product (I‚Äôve had better dumplings many times), but some of it was v good. Namely the pork soup dumplings and the filet mignon."

Views,"Dined on January 2, 2022",4,"Everything from the food, drinks, ambiance, and service was great. I just had to take a star off because we had to wait for over an hour even though we had reservations set. When we got to the restaurant it was pretty packed so it seems they had more reservations booked than they had available tables. Nonetheless, when we were finally seated the experience was near perfect from that point on. Thanks to Bacari for his amazing service, too."
Chyna,"Dined on January 2, 2022",4,"Overall the experience at Brooklyn Chip House was good. The food was great, it was just hard to locate our waiter at times. The music was also kind of too loud, so you can barely hear yourself. Overall great experience and place."

MonifahH,"Dined on December 31, 2021",4,"My first experience at Brooklyn was the best,  how ever my second visit was ok a lil disappointed. The lady who seated us was great.  Our server was ok  the food and drinks weren't really good.  Our peaking duck tacos was over cooked.  The lamb dumplings were okay and the pastrami was meh!!! There lychee froze was great the other drinks was not good.  The crispy filet mignon was salty but it was juicy and crispy.  I don't mind spending money if the food is good.  But it wasn't worth $285"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 31, 2021",5,Wonderful and unusual appetizers and small plates. The pastrami dumplings were different and the glazed ribs were awesome.
AngeliqueD,"Dined on December 31, 2021",3,"Waiter was too engaged with in a conversation at another table. Otherwise, food was great."
Burke12,"Dined on December 29, 2021",3,"Lettuce wraps were great, salads were pretty good, and dumplings were mediocre. Drinks were very good. Our table was under a speaker and the music was so loud we could barely hear each other during dinner. Service was rough. Waiter started by spilling one of the drinks on the table and never offered to clean it up or bring napkins. He was very slow, and was rude when he realized we had a 15% discount for staying at a local hotel- literally crumbled up the bill in his hand and walked away in a huff. However the rest of the staff was super friendly. Disappointed we took the recommendation from the hotel to try this place."
DihanneW,"Dined on December 29, 2021",4,"I guess this place has so much hype that people build it up so that it outweighs what they can do as far as service. The waiter was rude, distant and charged me incorrectly. When I pointed out the error, he did a full refund of the entire $350 bill (instead of just the $20 disputed charge) and charges the full bill AGAIN!! In conclusion.. I‚Äôve now been there & done that‚Ä¶ on to another cause I‚Äôm not coming back!"
RaashidaR,"Dined on December 29, 2021",5,"Great food, drinks and ambiance!"
MeenaE,"Dined on December 28, 2021",3,Pros: Good music  Private seating  Good location  Fried rice was amazing!  Good for birthdays   Cons: Table was wobbly‚Ä¶ for all that money you pay you would think you would have a steady table  Waitstaff lacked energy told them it was a birthday and the waiter forgot and made it so awkward  Steak wasn‚Äôt the best so disappointed in that‚Ä¶  They also did not check in had to flag someone down to get my cup refilled  Hostess were dressed super casual and looked like they didn‚Äôt want to be there   Just wanted expected a lot more given the celebrity recognition and food reviews again the Asian selection was great but just wish it was a bit more customer service friendly especially for it being fine dining.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 28, 2021",3,"Very cute restaurant. The asian-steakhouse fusion was interesting. Service was okay. Very cute, dimly lit spot with good music.  The steak.. would not recommend. I was veryyyy disappointed with my medium ribeye. The meat was dry and lacked flavor. I would not go back if I wanted to enjoy a steakhouse dinner.  On the other hand the asian dishes were all very good (bacon cheeseburger dumplings, rock shrimp tempura, ginger beef noodles, pork fried rice, kung pao chicken). That part of the fusion is done very well.   I hoped for more out of this Chop House"
Craig,"Dined on December 28, 2021",3,Not nearly as polished of a restaurant experience as I was hoping for. Seems like guests come here for special occasions.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 27, 2021",4,We had a great time. The good was excellent the garlic mash is a must have.
ShanaiB,"Dined on December 26, 2021",5,This is my go to place for holidays and any other occasion I can make a reason to pardon this establishment. Best dumplings in the business.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 26, 2021",5,"Service was just okay. We had to ask to order our drinks and when the waiter finally came, he just said ‚Äúyou want to order drinks.‚Äù. No welcome, no explanation of the menu. It‚Äôs minor but for these prices I‚Äôm expecting exceptional service. Pork soup dumplings and filet were excellent. Peking duck taco was a bit bland. Cocktails were great. I‚Äôm on the fence if I‚Äôd come back due to the prices, but I‚Äôll definitely be at their east village location to try more dumplings soon!"
Jeff,"Dined on December 26, 2021",5,Celebrated my birthday here.  The staff did an excellent job making my feel special and the food was Excellente‚ÄºÔ∏è
ShannonC,"Dined on December 26, 2021",5,This is the third time my family has dined here on Christmas Day!  Lovely as always and their Covid protocols were immaculate.  We felt safe and sanitary at our space. Food is impeccable.  Look forward to returning.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2021",5,Great ambiance! Amazing food and music definitely will visit again. The lobster fry rice slaps lol.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2021",4,Delicious food and drinks!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2021",4,the food was subpar and not what i expected at all
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 24, 2021",5,Beautiful date night. We had the sweet and sour chicken and filet Mignon with broccoli with a side order of shrimp fried rice. I can‚Äôt not complain. Food was 9/10.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 24, 2021",5,Everything was wonderful. We especially liked that our place setting and cups were wrapped up to ensure it was cleaned and sanitized!
HenryP,"Dined on December 22, 2021",5,"Overall experience was amazing, from the moment I walked up to the door. Hostess and managers were great, same for bar staff and waiter."
FabbsJ,"Dined on December 22, 2021",5,"Took my fianc√© here for his birthday yesterday and we had a wonderful time. I forgot I mentioned his birthday when making the reservation but they kept note and surprised him with a cake. Our waiter Kim was very friendly and provided great service. We had the filet mignon with broccoli, veggie fried rice, and the 16oz filet mignon crispy. The food was very tasty. Can't wait to go back!"
OswaldoC,"Dined on December 22, 2021",4,Everything was just fine. The food was very good and we enjoyed it. Our only problem was our waiter who wasn‚Äôt very personable or knowledgeable.
TiffanyC,"Dined on December 21, 2021",5,Great ambiance. Great vibes.  Great music. Great food and service.  Would go back again a million times.
TerenceM,"Dined on December 20, 2021",2,I reserved my table 4 hours prior yet I had to wait for a table. Table where to small and uncomfortable. Window was open behind me and gave a cold draft that forced me to put my hood on. Waiter didn't do much. She took my order and scram. She seemed to be over worked.
JulieP,"Dined on December 20, 2021",4,"Had a reservation for 7 pm and did not sit until 7:30. Did not get waited on until 7:50. I understand busy times. Nobody greeted our table, my husband has to ask if we had a waiter/waitress."
StarrL,"Dined on December 20, 2021",3,I had chicken and broccoli with chicken fried rice. It was good but it was cold.
ShanaiB,"Dined on December 20, 2021",5,"I am determine to try every mouth watering dumpling this place has to offer. This time around I had the lobster spring roll dumpling and my go to, the crab soup dumpling which were delightful. I also enjoyed the lobster and avocado salad with a lemon vinaigrette. it was not only refreshing but surprisingly filling. My waitress Tanisha was not only professional but very attentive to our needs. so grateful for her kindness. You can consider me a regular at the chop house! I was there for thanksgiving and will be returning for Christmas!"
JulienL,"Dined on December 19, 2021",4,Took quiet a while for us to be seated even with a reservation. There were groups of people with no reservation. Who was seated before us. That‚Äôs not fair. The food was great. Highly enjoyed it.great music
JennT,"Dined on December 19, 2021",1,"I had a reservation for 7 PM. We were not seated at a table until 8:03. They kept myself and my party standing outside in the rain because the very small lobby and bar area was filled to capacity. When we were permitted to go inside and check in with the hostess (who was very kind) we had to squeeze in the bar area over the tables that were eating.  The check of the vaccination cards were a joke as they didn‚Äôt ask for ID to go along with it and people just flashed quick pictures on their phones.  There was no enforcement of wearing masks while you waited for your table inside or with the employees.  The music was entirely too loud and there was a struggle to hear what the waiters/staff were saying to you. Due to the high volume the staff did not maintain social distance at all.  The tables were entirely too close together along the outer walls upstairs.  The food was‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say it left a lot to be desired and my entire group left unsatisfied and wishing we had made a different choice for our annual Christmas celebration dinner.  The best thing that I had on the menu was the apple crumb cheesecake and a glass of seltzer with lemon.  Overall, I would say save your money and a trip with expensive parking to Brooklyn Chophouse.  I should also add that it was extremely annoying that their door security saved multiple street parking spots with cones. This entitlement allowed their friends to have prime parking and walk right in without showing a Vaccination Card or wait on line."
Miche,"Dined on December 19, 2021",5,"It was an absolutely wonderful experience. The food options are diverse and taste as good as they look. The drink of the night was the ""Sour Deisel""... will be back!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 19, 2021",4,Ambiance was nice. Food was delicious. We felt rushed to get out by the service team. They didn‚Äôt stagger our appetizers as requested. We were still eating our appetizers when our entrees came out.  Overall nice meal.
kitty412,"Dined on December 18, 2021",5,"Food was perfect! We ordered the Pac-man dumplings, bok choi, beef lo mein, the ribeye and the ginger garlic mash."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 18, 2021",4,Everything was great just our waiter didn‚Äôt know much about menu or specific items so i had to call owner over an ask more about what i wanted an he knew right away an accommodate me
Steve,"Dined on December 18, 2021",5,Excellent food and service. The security were even nice and pleasnt. Our server was Jaiquan. What an incredible guy. He was outstanding.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 17, 2021",5,Me and my boyfriend loved the restaurant but when I asked for the piece of cake to sing the happy birthday to my bf they didn‚Äôt make special the moment
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 17, 2021",3,Food was delicious. Our server was rude and served what he wanted us to have not what we ordered. Thank goodness the bus staff and food runners were amazing. Never again
VW007,"Dined on December 17, 2021",4,I expected more out of the food but the level of service and the drinks were amazing.  I recommend the Lychee Fros√©.
EugeneC,"Dined on December 17, 2021",5,Great time and great food....
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 16, 2021",5,Had to wait a bit but the food and service was worth it.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 16, 2021",2,One person in our party was five minutes late and we had to wait almost forty minutes for our table even though we had a reservation. Then service was slow and overall the staff seemed overwhelmed.  The steak was average so not sure I‚Äôd try it again.
ElizabethB,"Dined on December 16, 2021",5,Great experience. I would definitely go back. The food and service was satisfying.
ShaniceS,"Dined on December 14, 2021",5,I loveee Brooklyn Chop House they honestly never disappoint the food is delicious !!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 14, 2021",2,"Honestly seemed like the staff was overwhelmed with the amount of people showing up‚Ä¶ Came for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday and we waited 30 minutes after our reservation time to be seated.. We were seated by the bar area but it took forever for our server to bring our drinks which is unfortunate because we want to order more as they were delicious.. I added a note to my reservation for a cake with a candle to come out at the end of the meal, and even reminded the hostess which was forgotten.. The server didn‚Äôt even offer dessert so I just ended up paying and grabbing dessert on the walk home‚Ä¶ very weird experience this time, every other time has been amazing. Very Disappointing"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 14, 2021",5,Great food! Great service.
ShariceA,"Dined on December 14, 2021",5,"Food was excellent, so was the service. I do suggest the pork chops üòã"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 13, 2021",1,The hostess sat us at a table where a lot of cold air kept blowing on us from the side entrance.. we had 2 small babies and they still didn‚Äôt make an exception to move us.. the hostess pretty much shrugged it off and kept saying she couldn‚Äôt move us even though we saw other tables. They also refused to close the door even though they have 2 different entrances. It was my birthday and my child is 5 months old and we were very uncomfortable.
SeanW,"Dined on December 13, 2021",5,"After just one visit, BCH has become my favorite restaurant. I visit one of the two locations whenever I‚Äôm in New York. The shrimp satay is a must. I absolutely love the food. The service is always great. The atmosphere is always energetic and vibrant. Most definitely a place you‚Äôll be glad you visited."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 13, 2021",5,"Food and drinks are on point. Taiesha was amazing, recommending tasty drinks and knew the menu very well.  Def will come again. üíØ"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 12, 2021",5,Friends 40th birthday!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 12, 2021",2,"Made a 6:30 reservation for indoors specifically. Showed up and was told the table indoors wasn‚Äôt ready and wouldn‚Äôt tell us when the table would be ready‚Ä¶they clearly gave away our table and weren‚Äôt prepared. We ended up getting a table outdoors 20 minutes later.  Food was good not great, service was fine, but extremely off-put that they didn‚Äôt honor our reservation."
JoanieG,"Dined on December 12, 2021",3,"Actually, the service was amazing but I thought the drinks were very weak! It taste like juice! Also, the wedge salad lettuce was humongous! It was not presented in a creative fashion. The lamb chops were bland, the salmon was over cooked. The appetizers were very tasty as well as the ribeye riblets. The lobster rice was too soft and mushy but the ginger garlic potatoes were good!‚Äô"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 12, 2021",5,The food was amazing. I especially loved the chicken satay. Rib eye was cooked to my expectation. I have no complaints.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 11, 2021",3,"Reservations were 40 minutes behind schedule and an expresso martini is 30 dollars because they charge you for 2 separate drinks. The food was okay, but our server was amazing."

brandonr,"Dined on December 10, 2021",3,Everything was just okay. Food was okay service was okay. Nothing stood out at this restaurant. I was extremely disappointed.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 10, 2021",5,"We had an AMAZING time at the Brooklyn Chop House. First off, hands down the most sanitary restaurant we‚Äôve ever seen lol. Alex was an awesome server; he was patient with our party and even joined in with the shenanigans. He gave great recommendations on drinks and food. The food was excellent, prepared to perfection. Plus they even made sure our birthday man of the hour was taken care of. 10/10 we will definitely be back!"
ChinaE,"Dined on December 10, 2021",5,"My favorite restaurant for all occasions! The food, service, ambiance everything was perfect."

Temi,"Dined on December 8, 2021",1,"Had a reservation for 6pm. Apparently, something was going on with the stove because at 6:30 I was told that there would be a wait for food because the stove was off. Shortly after that all of the power in the restaurant went out and once it came back on we were told that the food would take a little bit longer but that the restaurant would cover our next round of drinks. By now it's 6:50 and we still haven't received our food so we asked for the check and we were told that the round of drinks that were on the restaurant would not be brought to us/covered."
rogerw,"Dined on December 7, 2021",5,Great menu
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 7, 2021",5,"It was for a birthday and the only issue I would like to address is on my reservation, I did indicate that it was a birthday and that I wanted a happy birthday for the birthday person and we didn‚Äôt get anything."
TamaraI,"Dined on December 6, 2021",5,"Great COVID protocols in place and we were seated quickly. Made a reservation but we were early and there was no issue. Loved how all the dinnerware and glasses were wrapped and the wait staff quickly removed this in order for us to eat and feel safe about contamination. I know this must require a lot of work and it was well executed. Drinks were brought out quickly, the watermelon cooler was delicious!   We did the scallion noodles and beef to start, then ordered lamb chops, kung pao chicken, pork fried rice, and broccoli and garlic. Everything was delicious and well portioned.   When we go back, we‚Äôre going to try the duck. We heard great things, it just takes a bit of time to cook. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to others and we‚Äôre already planning our next visit. Thank you to the staff, Pooh, and everyone who has made Brooklyn Chop House a success thus far."
Brownsugga51,"Dined on December 6, 2021",5,"Love the food, love the vibe, BCH never disappoints! Amazing service too! Our waitress Taisha was awesome in every single way!

Natalia,"Dined on December 5, 2021",4,"This is one of the best restaurants I‚Äôve been at. The food, drinks and vibe overall is just amazing. The only reason why I can‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because I had the most inattentive server in my life. Never talked to us besides to take the order. Runners and bust boys gave us more attention than the server."
StephanieC,"Dined on December 5, 2021",5,Everything about this restaurant was amazing! Went there for my birthday dinner and I‚Äôm so happy I did. The shrimp fried rice and Caesar salad were to die for! Will definitely be returning.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 4, 2021",4,Overall great experience per usual
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 4, 2021",3,I love Brooklyn chop! The atmosphere is always dope and the music is always bumping. I would have given it a 6 but the seats I had last night where terrible. Every time someone walked past me my chair was hit and my coat kept being knocked off my chair which is not how anyone wants to spend there dinning experience. Service and food were fantastic!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 3, 2021",5,"Brooklyn Chop House is excellent. The food was great. We had the Porterhouse for two which was tasty and we had chicken skewers, avocado lobster salad as well as the pork fried rice.  Don Pooh you did your thing!! Bravo."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 3, 2021",4,"The service and cocktails were fantastic! The dumplings were fantastic!  The lettuce wraps were good, but ordinary.   The salad was supposed to have a lemon vinaigrette, but it was really sweet.  I highly recommend the dumplings.  We had the Ruben dumplings.  Perhaps it was just an off night because the service amd drinks were on point!"
KianieR,"Dined on November 30, 2021",5,First time at Brooklyn Chop house and it was amazing .
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 30, 2021",3,"The waitress spoiled the surprise for the birthday girl after several  hostesses kept the surprise going. How is that? She came to the table and said I know this is a surprise bday and your waiting on more people. The bday girl was already at the table. She had no idea others were coming to celebrate her. Then when asked about the drink difference in price she tried to sell us a lie, clearly she didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about as we had to ask fir a manager. When a waitress says we are being charged for shaking the drink (margarita) and lime juice, that‚Äôs a problem. However the manager was lovely and he was able to answer our questions."
Carlito,"Dined on November 29, 2021",5,great service and staff.  food was on point. nice music
Laci,"Dined on November 29, 2021",5,This is the second time I've been to this restaurant and I've had an incredible experience each time. I've celebrated my best friends birthday and decided to also make it a date night with the love of my life. Each time was incredible. The food was delicious. The drinks were incredible. The atmosphere was sexy. The waitstaff was so very attentive and made us feel welcome. They were on top of everything. My guests and I were well taken care of on both occasions. It was worth all of the money spent.
CarmenM,"Dined on November 28, 2021",1,Place was very crowed food was very blend no taste waiter was extremely nice
VALERIEM,"Dined on November 28, 2021",1,Overrated!!!!   Very expensive food - poor quality.  Food arrived at the table being very cold.  The server was very rude and disrespectful so we asked for a manager who never appeared.  Total bummer for a birthday dinner. I will not be going back to Brooklyn Chops not worth the hype.
ArnoldM,"Dined on November 28, 2021",5,"Celebrating My Wife's Birthday!  We had a Fantastic Time!  Everything was Superb! My daughter treated me to The Chop Shop this past Father's Day and I had a Great Time, I was impressed with the food, service and overall atmosphere."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 27, 2021",5,Anniversary dinner was great it‚Äôs pricey but worth it. Everything like the appetizer of dumpling crab  soup to the chocolate cake dessert was excellent !
Erin,"Dined on November 26, 2021",5,The restaurant was excellent. The food and drinks were delicious. Definitely worth every penny and the servings are big enough for leftovers.
DevoneW,"Dined on November 26, 2021",2,"Horrible initial seating, but maitre d/ manager, only after I requested, moved my table of 2 to a booth for 4. First time and wanted to try a few items. $453.72 including tip for 2. Server never realized that I was going to be the guest that needed a larger table and more attentive service. Porterhouse for 2 and my wifes entree were excellent. Sides, apps and cocktails were disappointing. Needs to improve bottle service. Lots of NYC comp on the porterhouse, but would order again. Recommend only for the steak"
tbell4,"Dined on November 26, 2021",5,Our first time dining here . Visiting from  Atlanta and had been referred from another guest (actually ) family member to owners . We had a very nice Thanksgiving dinner and our server started out very upbeat and exited to wait on us and mid way he seemed not so pleasant and accommodating. We were overcharged for the filet Mignon but he took so long to bring the check and check on us towards the end we jus to paid it unfortunately.  The food was delish and we made the most of the ambiance and joy of being together.  We will return - !
SHERI,"Dined on November 24, 2021",5,Took meh boyfriend here for his birthday and we both had a great experience. Great food & great vibes
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 23, 2021",1,"We ate at 4:30PM- got seated in the bar and NO ONE was in there and they played obscene music with explicit words which was obviously great for my 6,9, and 11 year old kids (sarcastic). Service was so poor and slow and ridiculously over priced. Will never return again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 22, 2021",5,"The service was excellent, from the friendly bouncers to the hostess, to the bus boys and waiters. The food was great as well. Definitely earned some major points with my lady. Highly recommended"
JanishaC,"Dined on November 22, 2021",3,Their food was amazing! The wait was a bit long due to the large party they were serving.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 21, 2021",5,Ordered the LSD. Was perfect. Steak bark on outside and cooked to medium rare.  Lobster was amazing.  Duck was the best we have had in years.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 21, 2021",5,Pretty great
TiffanyW,"Dined on November 21, 2021",4,"The food was very delicious, cooked to perfection! The service was good, not great. They only give you a 90-minute dining experience which was surprising and I'm not sure if that is the policy before the pandemic or implemented after but I didn't care for that stipulation. I would recommend but definitely not worth the online hype."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 20, 2021",3,Overall experience is nice. Made reservation for 10pm and still had to wait for nearly 45mins without efficient communication unless initiated with staff. Man standing outside was extremely rude but when seated we was given free 1st round of drinks. Manager exceptionally courtesy and service was exceptional. Will definitely recommend anyone to visit restaurant just be careful on a Friday night is busy.
Keke,"Dined on November 20, 2021",1,Making a reservation don‚Äôt make no sense because I had to wait forever n the lady that getting ur table was very rude ‚Ä¶.. for my first time I‚Äôm very disappointed
Cebastian,"Dined on November 20, 2021",2,Don‚Äôt bother making a reservations. I made an 8:30 reservation for standard indoor and still had to wait an hour to be seated. Luckily I ended up at the bar with my friend and got drinks and food there and by the time I was ready to be seated 9:20pm I ordered another drink and then took more food to go. Then we got sat by the kitchen door. And then the bathrooms was flooded. I‚Äôll just order take out from them from now on.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 20, 2021",3,"Our reservation was originally for 8 o‚Äôclock. When we arrived we had to wait online to check in for our reservation. Then the bouncers instructed us to wait until we are called on the side of the building and not block the front entrance. On the side of the building they had a heated seating area where we could wait for our table to be ready. It was very cold that night and there were a lot of people waiting to be seated. While we waited outside to be called for our reservation there were two young women outside screaming and cursing because they were put out of the restaurant. It was very intense. We waited outside for approximately 20 minutes. My goddaughter called the restaurant three times while waiting outside because of the commotion and the cold. We were seated at our table around 8:30pm even thou our reservation was for 8pm. Our waiter Kim, was very funny, nice and knowledgeable. The food was decent, drinks were decent. We went to use the restroom, there was toilet tissue in one stall. We had to pass the toilet tissue under/over the stall. The bathroom trash bin was over flowing with hand towels (please see photo). I was very disappointed in the overall experience. Our bill was $500 with gratuity."
ReaF,"Dined on November 20, 2021",4,"Waiter was not that friendly...seemed maybe tired or just ready to go...the bus boy was wayyy nicer. Food was actually really good and drinks were amazing...had reservations but still have to wait about 30mins to be seated. Overall, if u want a place to go and just like trying out different places I would say go...but I probably won't go back though for a $300 for 2 ppl bill I expected a more friendly & upscale environment"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 20, 2021",5,Sound system is magnificent
Ashley,"Dined on November 19, 2021",4,Definitely a great to place to take your partner/spouse or friends! The food was great especially for the price. The only complaint I had was that it was pretty crowded and loud but overall it was a great place and would absolutely come back.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 19, 2021",5,"Pre concert dinner with the girls! Great service , drinks and food. First time for some of the ladies and all were impressed.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 18, 2021",5,"I truly enjoyed my experience at BCH! Great service and great food! The Chicken Kung Pao was one of my favorites. Lychee Martini and Froze were delicious. The Philly Cheesesteak Dumplings were a bit bland, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get them again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 18, 2021",5,Great food and atmosphere - you need to go !
nightatthehawk,"Dined on November 18, 2021",2,"The bar was more standout than the food and restaurant.  Bartenders were extremely attentive and made outstanding drinks.  Our waiter had no idea what some of the menu items were and could not explain to us what the 7lb duck meant. I have never seen a 7lb duck served in a restaurant and I asked him if it meant that was how big the duck was prior to cooking and deboning.  He kept telling us ""no, it's a 7lb duck delivered to the table.""  What actually came to the table was of course not a 7lb duck.    The lobster fried rice hardly had any lobster and was not at all a good value.  The pork soup dumplings had a very tough and chewy wrapper that is not typical of xiao long bao.  The pac man dumplingers were cute but lacked any seafood flavor.  Tasted like a shrimp shumai."
EdwinM,"Dined on November 17, 2021",5,Expensive but justified by vibes and unique eats. Love coming here.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 15, 2021",5,Great food and a great experience

AP500,"Dined on November 15, 2021",5,the food was some of the best I've EVER had in my life.
ChristinaS,"Dined on November 14, 2021",5,"Dinner was amazing, from the appetizers to main course. Even the drinks were the best I‚Äôve ever had. Only problem we had was the reservation was only to hold a seat it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôll be seated at the time you slotted. I‚Äôll definitely be back @ chop house."
Saeedah,"Dined on November 14, 2021",3,Our waiter treated us like the drive by at Burger King. He rarely checked in on us and was only at the table for very brief moments. He seemed like he was rushing to get off of work. The bus boys came to remove our plates with out asking taking away appetizers we didn‚Äôt finish. It felt like they were rushing us to leave. Terrible service and food was just okay. Nothing amazing and not worth the price. Won‚Äôt be back.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 14, 2021",4,"Their reservation system needs a little bit of work, but the food made up for the hour wait."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 14, 2021",1,"Even with a reservation they made all of the guests wait outside in a line during 40 degree weather. My girlfriend and I ended up waiting 15 minutes freezing outside only to get checked in at the door and wait another 5 minutes for them to ""clean the table."" We were then walked to the tiniest table imaginable. It was in the middle of the walkway and appeared to have been placed their due to over booking. My girlfriend asked if we could change tables and we were told we couldn't. We didn't even bother ordering. I immediately secured a reservation at Mortons. The whole experience was such a mess. Never coming back here again. You would think for such an expensive restaurant, they would have better service. This almost ruined my anniversary date night. Honestly spend your money at another steakhouse who would actually value their guests. . . Heads up! The reviews section for this restaurant is flooded with fake 4 star and 5 star reviews. They are even so bold to use the same photos to try and validate the review!"

JessicaRabbitt,"Dined on November 11, 2021",2,The steak was so good! The sides were not as good. The french fries were not fresh. Frozen potatoes should not be served at a steakhouse

Mandy,"Dined on November 7, 2021",3,"The waiter Jake was very attentive, but overall I would not go back. From having to wait over 30 min for a reservation that we were on time for because they were overbooked, to the unseasoned bass and steak that we had with our prefix menu. Ordered and an overpriced VSOP drink with the smoke just to be told they didn‚Äôt have the smoke. The drink was horrible. The bathroom was a hot mess. FILTHY. One stall out of order so only one available for use. One faucet did not work.  definitely was not what I expected and will not be going back.   Honestly I was happy to try them but they are definitely overpriced and not worth it could have saved my family two thousand dollars which ended being out total.   I had better food at the Jue Lan Club!"
JacquiB,"Dined on November 7, 2021",5,Brooklyn Chop House was excellent!  The music is always on point.  Food was delicious. My party and I had a great time.

hmlw,"Dined on November 7, 2021",4,"BCH has energized this sleepy corner of Lower Manhattan! We ate outdoors, which is pretty mellow, but it was definitely hopping inside. Cocktails were delicious, and the steak and veal were quite good. Service was great, even on a very crowded Saturday night."

Tamika,"Dined on October 31, 2021",3,"The hype of this place was over rated. I was told we had 90 mins of seating time but it took 30 mins for the waiter to come to take our order. Then I hand order starters but it never came out ‚Ä¶my main course came out so quick too quick and when I went to go ask the server about my starter. He said he forgot and rushed to bring it out . Once he messed up ‚Ä¶he was extra nice and catering. The provided an extra drink on him but declined the offer as I was driving and kind of over the experienced. My relative that goes to the college around the corner said he wouldn‚Äôt go back . Would I go back, no but happy to say I experience it."

NatashaS,"Dined on October 24, 2021",5,Absolutely loved it! Alex was a superb waiter. He will be requested going forward. We had a early dinner so it wasn‚Äôt overcrowded and we weren‚Äôt rushed. Definitely recommend & I‚Äôll be back.
Alex,"Dined on October 23, 2021",1,Waited one hour after reservation time to be seated. Food was very average. Staff was friendly but could not make up for the one hour wait outside in the cold. Would not recommend and would not go back. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 23, 2021",3,"I honestly heard only good things about this place. A lot of hype.  But unfortunately it wasn‚Äôt the case for us.  We had reservations at 8:30pm on a Friday.  We got there 10 min earlier ,and trust me when I say it was a good thing we got there earlier . We had to wait on line OUTSIDE (55 degrees weather) just to see the host.  After 20 min of waiting outside we FINALLY saw the host, she then advised us that there is NO open seat at the moment and we need to wait (DID I MENTIONED WE HAD A RESERVATION?! oh okay‚Ä¶)  We asked to wait for a table (for our reservation of 2 people) OUTSIDE AGAIN! and as advised by the host and manager ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know how long this going to take but you can leave your number and we will text you)  So we did as advised and waited outside. For 25min! FINALLY - we walking to the table . And we were seated by the bar‚Ä¶ The place was packed!! The bar was crowded with people! So crowed that for the whole dinner it felt like they were eating with us at the table !  We waited 20 min for our drinks (we had the spicy watermelon margarita- it was sour and not strong at all!)  Thank God we ordered appetizers because we waited for 45 minutes for our entrees.. oh and that‚Äôs 45 minutes after we finished the appetizers .so as you can imagine we waited A LONG time for the food.  We had the veal chop and lamb chop ! - the veal chop was too well done although we asked for medium rare, and the lamb chop was burned as we asked for medium well.  I was scared to asked to get a new lamp chop since this took over an hour to get to our table but I had too asked for a new one since I couldn‚Äôt eat burned meat!  As we are waiting for the new lamb chop we asked for drinks, that took another 20 min to arrive to the table. And when they did we realized we received the wrong drinks. Took another 15 min to get someone to pay attention to us for us to request for the correct drinks.   OVERALL, the staff was nice and music was good. We didn‚Äôt enjoy anything else."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 18, 2021",5,"The restaurant was quiet. We were seated in the front at a very spacious booth. The service was prompt. The waiter was knowledgeable about the food and drinks and recommended some great choices. The food was amazing to say the least. We had the salt & pepper calamari and lobster wontons to star, lamb chops and lobster fried rice for our main meal and finished with apple crisp wontons for dessert! The wait time before each course was perfect! 5/5 for me."

Drinks were great and strong. Food was delicious and service was excellent. I also really appreciated the Saran Wrap on the silverware due to covid. We will definitely be back. Also we dined indoors but the outdoor seating also looked very aesthetically pleasing.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 13, 2021",5,I took my boyfriend there for his birthday. From me getting my cake parked by the security to walking in and being greeted amazingly.

TSJknows,"Dined on October 13, 2021",2,"There are so many great restaurants in this area. Don‚Äôt waste your time here. The hip hop tunes were great, and the staff was lovely. The food was just not good. This is a place for great drinks and fun, not for a diner looking for well prepared art on a plate (and in your belly)."
foodie,"Dined on October 13, 2021",5,My husband and I love this place - the food is extraordinary and the service is always exceptional - A special shout out to Taiesha our food server and Dewey.  This restaurant has the best food and best service - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!

Vashti,"Dined on October 10, 2021",4,While this restaurant has an alluring menu - it falls short in delivery.  The food isn't worth the price.  My bill for 4 people was $600 including the tip and nothing was as memorable as the one Lychee Froze that I ordered.  Our waiter made the experience pleasant at least.
GigiH,"Dined on October 10, 2021",5,Food & service was amazing!

Kiki,"Dined on October 4, 2021",2,"The food was okay, it‚Äôs overhyped on social media. The beef came back dry in the middle. The drink are really good but other than that the server was really nice. Everyone have different taste buds I‚Äôd say go and try a taste of yourself !"

Kilolo,"Dined on October 2, 2021",4,Food was delicious it never disappoints! The portion size are to be shared. The lobster dumplings however did not taste like lobster. The rib eye steak melts in your mouth. The filet mignon and broccoli is to die for. Of course the soft crab fried rice and the lobster fried rice are both amazing.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 2, 2021",4,Great time ! Awesome experience!
MAdanF,"Dined on October 2, 2021",5,Caesar salad was great as was the filet.  Service was very attentive but slow. Very nice place to take someone special.  Food was delicious.

GMadia,"Dined on September 30, 2021",3,"Intrigued by the unusual menu we booked a dinner. The restaurant is comfortable and has a nice ambiance. To start, the two mint and cucumber cocktails were very good. The appetizers were also tasty. We had the lamb dumplings and chicken lettuce wraps. Little did I know that at that point our experience had peaked. As for the entrees, first the good, my son's 16 oz filet mignon was exceptional. Cooked perfect and very tasty. However, my salt & pepper sea bass and my wife's crispy beef were extremely disappointing. When I order a $42 sea bass entree I not expecting it to be thinly cut, breaded and deep fried. It looked more (and tasted) like a haddock fish fry than a higher quality piece of fish. The taste was fairly bland and it needed the two dipping sauces...again this is sea bass not cod. The crispy beef came batter dipped and it had more batter than beef. TBH it looked and tasted like something from a mall food court. Both dishes were hugely disappointing and a terrible value at $42 and $35. I don't have any issue spending $ if the food is good. For example my son's 16 oz filet was $64 and I had zero issue with the price, as it was a solid cut and cooked to perfection.   Again, the restaurant was well reviewed and the combo steak house/Asian food vibe is/was intriguing. However going one for three (on the entrees) may get you into Cooperstown but it's not going to generate a whole lot of repeat business."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 28, 2021",1,Food was unflavored just overall nasty rice and drinks was good
naturalnube,"Dined on September 27, 2021",5,Awesome dining experience!!!
FritzS,"Dined on September 26, 2021",2,The food wasn‚Äôt good at all all you‚Äôre paying for is location it‚Äôs a Chinese restaurant just overpriced and overhyped
TaraL,"Dined on September 26, 2021",4,The service was amazing. For that alone I would return. My only issue is there was a wait to be seated even with a reservation. If it was 10-15 ok wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue. But we waited on a line for about 20 min to give them our name for our reservation. Then waited about another 20-25 min to be seated.
JocelynP,"Dined on September 26, 2021",5,"Well I sat outside with my husband, due to him not being vaccinated. But I love how they had the cups and plates with fork and knife, wrapped up on the table. Like to see that they are taking our new situation serious. But this is literally my third time going and I love their food and them damn dumplings. Lol"
TroyW,"Dined on September 26, 2021",5,This was an awesome time and experience. I can‚Äôt wait to go back. My only complaint is that they didn‚Äôt have any aprons for sale in store. Lol.  I cannot wait to go back.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 26, 2021",5,Beautiful ambiance. Amazing server. Great food. Altogether great experience!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 25, 2021",5,Great service and the food was good.. our waiter was awesome. Another waiter was just as nice. His name was J High!! Ask for him when you come he‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 25, 2021",5,Nice cool vibe. Food was amazing and service was fast.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 25, 2021",3,The experience at this highly recommended restaurant was a disappointment.   Felt like eating at a club - not a quality food restaurant. If you are a foodie you should pass. The service was mediocre.   For same money go to a real steak house.   Unless you just want to experience the unique vibe and atmosphere.
AnnaQ,"Dined on September 25, 2021",5,"Top notch service, food, and music! Jake is the best waiter ever!!  You won‚Äôt regret coming here."

GT90,"Dined on September 13, 2021",4,"Food was great and our waiter Bukari was amazing! Only reason I am not giving a full 5 stars is because we waited about 25min before even being allowed into the building. Apparently the restaurant opens at 4pm--but if they are not readily able to welcome people in at this time, there shouldnt be an option to have a 4pm reservation. There was a crowd of people waiting to get in and the employees there were still setting up tables and taking out the trash."

CookieBee,"Dined on September 12, 2021",5,"I was there last night 9/11/2021 celebrating my birthday with my husband and brother. My brother referred this restaurant and I must say, very clean and the decor was beautiful. I like our table not to mention our server for the night , his name is Kim. Kim was very knowledgeable of the menu and made some suggestions for us. He also gave us time to check the menu out to make our selections. Kim kept checking on us to make sure everything was good with us. The food and drinks was excellent.  I will be going back and I will definitely recommend Brooklyn Chop House for any occasions."
FoodieNYC,"Dined on September 12, 2021",4,"The outdoor setup gave a nice atmosphere.The restaurant seemed understaffed as it took the server nearly 20 minutes to attend to us. We had to ask the hostess for assistance twice.  We had to send the Philly cheesesteaks dumpling back it did not taste like a Philly, the Crispy pork was dumpling was only ok and Not so crispy after being stuffed in the dumpling. The Colorado lamb was Fantastic, the baby bok choy and fried rice were also great! My friend had the sweet and sour chicken it had great flavor but was a little heavy on the breading. On top of it all they ran out if Chocolate , so no Hot fudge Sunday! Overall my friend and I still enjoyed ourselves and would still return."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 11, 2021",1,"We had a 9pm reservation and didn‚Äôt get seated until 10:45pm. Absolutely unacceptable, only reason we stayed was because everything else in the area was closed. Worst restaurant experience, they need to learn to not take so many reservations if they don‚Äôt have the tables to sit them. Once we finally ate 2 hours later the food was great but the overall experience turned us all the way off."
RobinH,"Dined on September 11, 2021",5,"The atmosphere, the service and the food was amazing.  We were treated like rockstars. If you want a fun, energetic dining experience with great music, this is the spot.  I will be back again and again."

Panateama,"Dined on August 28, 2021",3,"The food was great.  A nice evening of dinning was spoiled. Don‚Äôt go there and order the LSD and expect to have your duck carved at the table. When we asked several staff including manager the response was ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt do that because it is too busy‚Äù or we discontinued that last year. Manager was clueless. If an experience is not included as advertised, customer should be informed when order is placed.we essentially got a shrug from the manager. Very disappointed"

SeanC,"Dined on August 22, 2021",1,Had a horrible experience. I have ordered from them before but have never eaten at the restaurant. The service was just really bad. Asked for a normal table and they tried to give us a bar high top (which is uncomfortable); we had a reservation and still took 40 mins to be seated; had to send my steak back because it was overcooked; kitchen refused to slice my steak so my server had to do it (she was working as hard as she could).

We started with the chicken satay, which were delicious, then we got the porterhouse for two, which was nicely seasoned and cook. The filet portion was like a marshmallow. Overall had a great time, definitely would go back."

Waveyy,"Dined on August 10, 2021",5,"I love when places live up to the hype! Took bae here on Monday night for date night and we were not disappointed! The price tag is a little high but the food, drinks, and service was on point so it was definitely worth it! Natalia T was our waitress and she was great! She made some great suggestions and advised against certain things based on both her personal experience and other customer's. All her recommendations we ended up trying we're definitely on point! DRINKS: were really good and strong! I had the lychee froze to start and bae had a mix of the lychee and red velvet froze ($20 each). Bae wasn't sure which one she wanted so Natalia offered us samples of both to help us decide. Round 2 was the lychee ($16) & coconut/mango ($19) martinis (can you tell I love lychee lol). Natalia pointed out that the lychee martini was really creamy and thick and she didn't lie! It's the thickest lychee martini I've ever had which was a bit unusual but it was really tasty! I finished off with my other favorite, sidecar ($19) & bae had the casamigos blanca ($18) . Now while I live a sidecar, I don't always order it because not everyone knows how to make it right but it was definitely on point! I only wished the amount wasn't so small.  Food: came out freshly made and sizzling! Everything was seasoned to perfection as well, omg yum! I don't eat beef so no steak for us lol. We had the lobster Satay served with peanut sauce (2 pieces for $30) & crispy chicken wontons (5 pieces for $15) as our appetizers. Both were really good & I loved the fact that they didn't overcook the lobster! For our main course, I had the pork chops (2 pieces for $42 but they were nice & thick!) and bae had the spicy nine season shrimp ($42. I didn't count them lol but it was about 6 pieces). Sides are family sized/for sharing & we went with the garlic ginger mashed potatoes ($14), chicken fried rice ($14), and the broccoli & garlic ($17).  Everything was so tasty & the portion size was more than enough"
Kajthekritic,"Dined on August 9, 2021",1,Would never go here again. The food was bland and terrible . I would be doing a full review on my food page @kaj.the.kritic
ORITD,"Dined on August 9, 2021",5,Great food. Great vibe. Great waitress. Will definitely return
Queen,"Dined on August 8, 2021",3,"Everything on the menu was expensive! Even the water was $10! Like what?!? Who pays $ 10 for a bottle of water! Idc if it‚Äôs Fuji water. It shouldn‚Äôt be more than the cost of soda! Yes the soda was $5 which was water down by all the ice put in the glass cup! Fried rice which I could‚Äôve got from the chinese restaurant was $28 and honest it wasn‚Äôt that great.  My total bill was $154! The only thing I enjoyed was the red velvet cake which we all shared because 1 slice of cake is $18. I would also like to include that as we‚Äôre eating, the cleaners kept coming to our table picking up our plates and utensils. It got to the point when I had to ask them if they wanted us to leave. I never seen that before! I kept think they either wanted us to leave or had a shortage of plates! I wouldn‚Äôt go there again. I think they‚Äôre selling the experience of being there since a lot of celebrities ate there but honestly I could get way better soap dumplings and fried rice up the block from where I live and pay wayyyyyyyyyyy less!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 8, 2021",3,Inappropriate music playing ( lot for fouls language) while young niece was there eating.
alanas,"Dined on August 8, 2021",4,"a bit overrated , The food took forever to come out. The scannable menu had items that was no longer available. Once again fir the price wasn‚Äôt really worth it . The restaurant was fairly empty and they sat us right next to someone else."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 7, 2021",5,I love Brooklyn Chop House. Service was excellent food was great. Sat at bar while waiting for table and the bartender mixed some Dope complimentary drinks for review. They were delicious. My favorite to go place for dining.
Jonae1987,"Dined on August 7, 2021",5,The service and food at Brooklyn Chop House is outstanding from the time you walk-in to the time you leave. I left very satisfied and had an amazing time. Definitely will be returning.
LoriR,"Dined on August 7, 2021",5,"We picked BCH to celebrate a friend‚Äôs recent promotion and an upcoming birthday.  My friends got stuck in very bad traffic which caused them to be thirty minutes late‚ÄîI panicked because I know some restaurants will cancel your reservation‚Äînot BCH!  The hostess was very sweet and understanding, she checked me in early and suggested I go to the bar for a cocktail while waiting for the rest of my party to arrive.    I took her advice and to my surprise purchased an overpriced glass of house Chardonnay.  I go out a lot and $19 for a glass of average wine is a little over the top.    Once everyone arrived we were seated and our server, Boukary (such a sweet heart) helped us make some excellent cocktail and appetizer choices.  The Red Velvet froze is beyond delicious, as are the, spicy lamb gyro and philly cheesesteak dumplings. On scale of 1-10‚Äî10‚Äôs across the board!  For entrees we ordered,  salt + pepper sea bass, sweet +sour chicken, crispy shrimp fried rice and soft shell crab fried rice.  To our surprise all were very average‚Äîon a scale of 1-10, we gave it an overall score of 5.  It‚Äôs safe to say it‚Äôs the apps and cocktails for me!   We were pleasantly surprised when Boukary surprised us with two slices of red velvet cake complete with sparklers! When he introduced himself, he asked us what bought us to BCH‚Äî and he actually remembered.  That‚Äôs definitely a reflection of the owners.   The only thing we didn‚Äôt like‚Äîbut totally understand is that they gently nudge you to eat quickly and get out.     Other than that I will be going back for cocktails + apps."

EmilyG,"Dined on August 4, 2021",5,"This restaurant is across my school  and I have been wanting to eat there for so long. Now that I have, I was not let down. The food was very good even though I don't think some of the food matched the expensive prices. The dumplings were amazing and worth the price. The staff was so friendly and attentive I never had to wait or even think of what I wanted before they came and did it themselves. Our server even gave us a free dessert which we loved and finished even though we said we were stuffed. I will definitely come back again for a nice dinner out."

The decor is great. The food is delicious! Seriously, the food is really good and well prepared. The bone-in rib eye was perfectly cooked, the broccoli, kung pao chicken, duck tacos, spring rolls and chicken fried rice were delectable. Even the French fries were in another level.  Definitely going back."
Mugga215,"Dined on August 1, 2021",3,Sides were great also the red snapper was delicious and fresh but I asked for my steak to be medium rare but yet I got a steak that was medium well so it threw my whole meal off and didn‚Äôt want to ask for another one because it already took my steak almost 40 minutes to come to the table

Yummilicious,"Dined on July 31, 2021",4,I liked the restaurant. Our bartender and our server were excellent. One bus boy was great too. They lost me when two women came over and started clearing our plates before we were all finished. Pushy about it as well. More like housekeepers at a budget motel chain at check out time than at a high priced dining establishment.  The food was well prepared.  Nice touch that they brought the birthday girl cake with a sparkler candle in it!
ThishinJ,"Dined on July 31, 2021",5,It was perfect first date location great ambience Great Food outstanding service valet parking it was awesome definitely plan on going back a bit on the pricey side but the food was so well worth it. Best steak I‚Äôve ever had

AprilL,"Dined on July 28, 2021",5,"Always a winner! For dining in or taking out.  Garlic noodles, pac man dumplings & Best filet in town. Brooklyn Chophouse will not disappoint!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 28, 2021",4,"We preferred to sit outside. The ambiance was good, they had a speaker playing music. Even though they have partitions I think the walking area to get in and out was a bit too tight.  The food was amazing, to start our order with the lobster dumplings, spicy and delicious; our entr√©e was the porterhouse for 2, with a side of garlic broccoli and a house salad .  The service was good, waiters we're attentive to us and our requests.  Will definitely go back to try out the lamb chops."

Simplyiyah,"Dined on July 17, 2021",5,Everything was great for the most part. I was just disappointed that the 4lb lobster was chopped down and fried. I sent it back. Then he returned with a new version of it chopped down in a garlic sauce that more so seemed to me like gravy. I‚Äôm a seafood lover. I expected the big red lobster with drawn butter. I ended up canceling both and had lamb chops. They were amazing.

Seec,"Dined on July 5, 2021",3,"We didn't realize this is steakhouse with Asian fusion. Some may like the combination. It's not for me. I ordered BLT wedge salad. I recieved huge head of lettuce split in half with bits of bacon and sliced tomatoes on rim. I have to say the presentation of the food is not what I expected from this restaurant. Probably due to covid but the food is overpriced. 2nd dish ordered chicken wontons. Theses were delicious...no complaints. Entree was short rib. I'm used to short ribs with nice garlic butter mashed potato. This came with noodles!! Complete disappointment. The short rib was very tasty but noodles ruined it. Plus the dish was $42!! Noodles are very cheap and to side it with short rib was ridiculous. Total bill for 3 people $239. 2 orders short ribs, 1 order shirmp dish, chicken wonton, salad, bottled water, 1 cocktail, 1 order fries. This should of been under $200. I'm a foodie. I will pay for good food. This just wasn't it."

The wait staff was so attentive, especially our waiter. We ordered salads before our meal as we always do. We assumed the salads would be side salads and small. Nope. Lol. They were a great size and could easily be shared between two people. You get great size portions for your money. The food is as amazing and the birthday red velvet cake was to die for. I will for sure go again."

KenS,"Dined on July 1, 2021",4,"Had one of the best rib eye steaks I've ever tried at this restaurant.  As an Asian American, I particualrly enjoyed the Asian fusion concept as I've never gone to a steak house where I could enjoy a steak with traditional white rice as a side.  Note that this is the complimentary side it with entrees.  My wife went with the spicy shrimp which she said was good.  We ordered the philly cheese steak dumplings to start but didn't taste anything cheese steak in nature.  They were still good so I'm just not sure if that's what they were supposed to taste like or if the waiter got the order wrong.  We also ordered the short rib bao buns which were pretty good.    It was a shame that the AC was not working in what was the hottest day of the 2021 summer but it wasn't terrible in the restaurant, just a tad warm.    I enjoyed the music and ambiance of the restaurant.  Definitely more trendy then more traditional steak houses.    Overall I'd like to go back and try some other dishes and would recommend this restaurant to people.  For the 2 of us, without alcohol, our bill can up to a little over $200 including the tip."

Bonnie,"Dined on June 29, 2021",2,"We wanted to like BCH, but we didn‚Äôt. The martinis were undrinkable, the avocado in the lobster salad was brown and the over abundance of greens was drenched in dressing, the dumplings were poor. The only good thing was the broccoli. We won‚Äôt return."

Jannnanana,"Dined on June 28, 2021",3,"I chose this restaurant for our anniversary, thinking it would be a high-end, intimate location that had seemingly great COVID protocols. What I found instead: the server rushed us to get our orders in, stating they were busy, the room was hot and crowded (we should have sat outside but it was also hot and crowded), the people next to us were sat way too close to really have our own conversation, the plates were covered with Saran Wrap (really tacky) and the food was not worth how much we paid. Really felt let down by all the hype about this place."
AkivaH,"Dined on June 28, 2021",4,"I originally made our reservation for 2, however a friend joined at the last minute and they easily upgraded us to 3 with no problem. We were also allowed to be seated a few minutes early. Initially the waiter didn't seem that warm, but as time went along his attitude got better. Our food did take a little long to come, however when it came we didn't care because the food was so good! Overall a very positive experience, and I will take the drive from Philly to NY to come back."
EliasM,"Dined on June 27, 2021",2,"If you're black and want to be perceived as being upwardly mobile, this is the place for you. Patrons come dressed as if this is the pregame for getting Turnt at the club afterwards. Food is delightfully mediocre and the prices exorbitant.

Tiffany,"Dined on June 24, 2021",5,"I love this restaurant, the vibe is always just right, food never misses a beat and the ambience is so warm and welcoming. Tony the manager is absolutely amazing! He is so personable and friendly. This has become one of my go-to places."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 24, 2021",5,The service was out of this world!
NicoleB,"Dined on June 23, 2021",3,"Dinner Reservation was for 8:00. Like other parties we waited more than half an hour to get seated. Food was good, but overpriced as the wine menu. Service, once seated was good, but the wait and no communication before‚Ä¶ not cool"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 23, 2021",5,Excellent Service  A little Pricey Food taste great
Fatima,"Dined on June 22, 2021",5,The food is always good. I typically go on Monday evenings after work and there‚Äôs always a great vibe. On the weekend the place is bustling and alive. A great night out to hang with friends and family and a lovely atmosphere for a date or a special celebration. An NYC gem.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 22, 2021",5,Great! Definitely coming back. Everything was A1
Victoria,"Dined on June 22, 2021",5,"I can‚Äôt even count how many times I have been to this restaurant my whole family is hooked unto it, good food, I mean great food.excellent service.üëçüèæ"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 21, 2021",4,Everything was great didn‚Äôt notice that they had a Father‚Äôs Day planned menue per person that put me out of budget! Which it was put up on their web but it‚Äôs good apart from that.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 21, 2021",3,"Father‚Äôs Day 2021. Made reservations ahead of time after reviewing their menu. Once I checked in they advised me there was a prefix menu which was $145 pp. and that they had attempted to call me. NOT TRUE. A voicemail would‚Äôve been nice. After driving over an hour , I was not going to leave and it was Father‚Äôs Day. The service was good, the drinks were weak and the steak was a 7/10. The chicken satay was not soft and juicy and the dumplings were hard. Maybe I‚Äôll give them another try on a regular night but this Father‚Äôs Day dinner was less then good."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 20, 2021",5,Was great!  Excellent food and service!!

IrisS,"Dined on June 17, 2021",3,"Hosts was rude and asked me wait when I had a reservation. Did not  even allow us to wait at bar. I guess we were not "" huchy' enough Too much noise. You could not hear a conversation with the constant loud rap music . Not happy to have my 18 kid hear music about eating p*** or sucking d*** while eating dinner. The servers were slow to bring food, but fast to hang around to take the plates. Our waiter was very nice, Jacob, but he was stretched and I waited for the bill too long (if you want to clear tables ...) .  Food was great, filet mignon was burnt, but the lobster, fried rice, dumplings were awesome. Would order  delivery but not sit there again"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 16, 2021",3,"Very disappointing!!! The staff were friendly. The atmosphere was vibrant and fun but a bit too noisy for me. The food was where I was very disappointed. The sides - pork fried rice and bok choy were both delicious. But we came for the steak. We ordered a porterhouse for two. And for it to cooked medium. When it came it was terrible. Over cooked, chewy, no flavour!  And it make matters worse they knew we were out celebrating my husband‚Äôs birthday. So they brought us a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù cheese cake with a sparkler and a side of ice cream. We didn‚Äôt order it. We of course assumed it was complimentary as we didn‚Äôt order it. But they put it on the bill!! I thought that was dishonest and tacky. Our night - meals and drinks for two cost us $400!! It was worth even half of that! Won‚Äôt be going there again.  Very sad."

He made incredible cocktails and had a good sense of our taste palates with very few questions. He is very knowledgeable! Leo was so warm and welcoming and fun! Thank you Leo!"
LisaO,"Dined on June 10, 2021",2,The staff was very friendly and the service attentive. The food was about the level of a cheap Chinese take out. We were shocked that the menu was predominately dumplings and noodles with a few steaks thrown in. The bar was off as well with flat tonic and watered down vodka.  Wish I could give this place a better review because the staff was so nice!
Chevy,"Dined on June 8, 2021",5,"Decent spot to dine with a very nice atmosphere.  I was expecting a bit more of the place since it was so hyped up but all in all, wonderful experience."
Leah,"Dined on June 7, 2021",5,"Great food and service! I just wish the seating wasn't so close to each other. We were placed between to other couples. One of which was only separated by glass, so you can hear everything each person saying. The other couple was a bit further but you could still hear each other's convo. Not very intimate but if you don't care if others are so close they can hear your entire convo, then you'll be fine."
RandyP,"Dined on June 6, 2021",1,"Booked reservation two months in advance. Waited for our table for one hour, triple booked our table. A lot of side door reservations pushed our placement back. Had to take our food to go because the wait was so long. Felt very bad for the waiter and busses because they were by themselves in outdoor seating. But... Best Ribeye I‚Äôve ever had... Sadly wouldn‚Äôt recommend to other people unless upper management helps their workers with staffing and reservation issues."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 6, 2021",5,Brooklyn chop house was amazing..the food was delicious and the atmosphere of the restaurant was calm. The crab dumpling soup is to die for and the lamp chop was perfect. Overall I‚Äôm definitely coming back again and as well recommending them to my friends

ChristineR,"Dined on June 3, 2021",3,"Our waiter could have been more attentive. I requested one of my dinner plates not to be put under the warmer, because it was for a toddler and it was still placed under the warmer."
GuyanesePrincess,"Dined on June 3, 2021",1,"My companion dropped me off at the entrance while he went to go park the car. I went inside and told the hostess my name and that my companion was parking the car and he will be right over. She advised me that I would have to wait outside until he arrived, intentionally I didn't have an issue with this until when I went back inside and saw that she told two other groups that they can wait inside or in the seating area, it is to be noted that these other two parties weren't African -American like myself. You can imagine my surprise since this option wasn't presented to me . The food, ambiance and our waiter were all wonderful, but I just couldn't shake the way I was treated by the hostess."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 31, 2021",5,I thought I was going to a steakhouse and it‚Äôs going to a fantastic Chinese restaurant that also serves steak.

NotComingBack,"Dined on May 24, 2021",3,"The food here was good but not worth the $$$. Essentially regular Chinese food on a fancy plate. Service was subpar, order was not correct and the staff had no idea what was going on. Very loud with ppl singing like it was karaoke night. Def not the place to enjoy a quiet romantic dinner. Not to mention we were forced to order everything we wanted at the same time and then the entrees came out way before the appetizer smh. Had I not said something to the waiter we would‚Äôve never gotten it he never came over to tell us they ran out and had to make more he jus made up an excuse on the fly. We had reservations which we showed up on time and still had to wait 15 min standing outside ‚Äúto make sure our table was ready‚Äù Def won‚Äôt be returning back here."

mimif,"Dined on May 17, 2021",5,Amazing!!!
tanikab,"Dined on May 16, 2021",4,"We were slightly disappointed abouy a very minute issue, that wasnt the restaurants fault. The waiter said speak to the manager, and called him over right away. We expressed our little issue, not expecting anything, and he immediately stated ""1 round of drinks, on the house"". We were all impressed. Thats the type of service, you will receive. Our waiter was so on point. I can tell, great service is paramount, here."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 16, 2021",1,My husband loves duck so he ordered the 7lb duck which looked more like 2lbs it was served on a plate in slices not whole with some soft taco shells which we were told by the waiter and server that‚Äôs how the 7lb duck is served. My husband also ordered the porterhouse steak which was 48 oz and I ordered the salt and pepper lobster/3lbs. And by comparison the duck looked nothing like the the steak or lobster in size both which were less in weight was more than the 7lb duck.The bill was $486.00. Not what I expected it to be. Very disappointed. Was looking forward to bringing our family if we had enjoyed it. The rice was mediocre nothing to rave about.
AYANAJ,"Dined on May 16, 2021",4,"I had the lobster spring rolls and Beef and broccoli with a side of rice. All was good, the beef was tender and tasty and it even tasted great the next day (leftovers)."

Murray,"Dined on May 13, 2021",4,"Overall I must say that I really enjoyed dinner at Brooklyn Chophouse.  Food was WONDERFUL , service was attentive, the ambiance was energetic and vibrant!! I will say that this is a great place for get togethers, special occasions , or just a nice dinner.   My only concern was that I made a reservation for 10pm and still had to wait close to 30 min before even being allowed inside. So, we had to wait outside in the cold.  After 30, min we were allowed to sit at the bar to wait for a table to become available.  I will say that the staff was friendly and tried to work expeditiously to resolve.  I understand that things get busy , but making a reservation is important for me and having a table ready is even more important.  Hope that the experience gets better and management can find a way to work around this. Thanks!"

Jonathan,"Dined on May 10, 2021",5,Great spot for couples food is amazing still have to wait if you RSVP
WaverlyG,"Dined on May 10, 2021",3,"It would of been helpful if when I made earlier reservations for the Mother‚Äôs Day dinner that the menu was previewed a prix fixed at $145 per person. Nevertheless, my family was happy with the food offered and prepared. The choice of two appetizers was a definite plus along with the dessert options.  Despite the fact that there were limited seating requirements, the occupancy was overwhelming crowded.  Our next visit will probably be when there is no special dining occasion."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 10, 2021",3,I‚Äôve been waiting on this dining experience for quite some time and decided to make a reservation for Mother‚Äôs Day. We didn‚Äôt know there was a pre-fixed menu for today so that was very disappointing.  They claimed their best items were part of the menu selection however all of the food was mediocre besides the rib eye steak. We had each of the 8 appetizers and had to send back two of them. The lobster and crab options were definitely not worth it. Our waiter was great but still not worth $145pp which was for a family of 4. Not what i expected for a $700 bill and not even being able to order from their main menu! Definitely overrated and not worth the money in my opinion.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on May 10, 2021",5,Always a good dining experience

JamesL,"Dined on May 7, 2021",4,"Came here with a group of 4. Food was excellent and their wine list is pretty solid if you plan to have a bottle with your steak. The only complaint is the service, understandably they were busy so tried to order everything at once. They missed one item that eventually came out as we asked for the bill. No big deal, just something that happens.  Would come back and recommend to other people."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 23, 2021",4,"It was very nice to come to Brooklyn Chop house for a 4th time since Valentine‚Äôs Day. However, this time, although our server was nice. It wasn‚Äôt until we paid the bill that he (Niko) was rude! He was not satisfied with his tip, and what we did not appreciate was how he left the Restuarant lookin for us - asking for an ADDITIONAL TIP! HORRIBLE!  I‚Äôm not sure what hospitality means to Brooklyn Chop House, but I‚Äôm sure THAT BEHAVIOR is unacceptable, and not tolerated! It left us in a uncomfortable mood for my friends birthday. However, I will be returning to The Restuarant soon, and I can ensure you that everytime I visit- and I personally speak with a manager and explain why we don‚Äôt want Niko to serve us... that‚Äôs if he still works there."

Thank you guys for all your hard work and your patience and your great customer service see you this summer!
JenniferM,"Dined on April 19, 2021",2,Waiter was had no patience rushed my whole dinner seating horrible they sat us by the door and it was cold
RachelD,"Dined on April 19, 2021",1,The food was waaayyyyy too overpriced paid 89 for a whole duck and I didn't even get the bones the waiter lied to me he wasn't as attentive as he shld have been and I have had waaaayyyyyy better food priced lower. Dont even waste your money it's not worth the hype
chyG,"Dined on April 19, 2021",5,"We originally wanted an inside table but they were at max capacity so we sat outside, but it was beautiful out and we really enjoyed our server! The only complaint I have about our table is that it was a little wobbly and very small. We had a few issues maneuvering plates and drinks and the plexiglass but that was the only hiccup for the evening. Our food was amazing in our server was very attentive and informative and responsive"
ShaniJ,"Dined on April 19, 2021",5,Would recommend this spot to all my ppl‚Ä¶ BLM‚Ä¶ A plus
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 19, 2021",5,"1. This was mine and my boyfriend's first time eating here.  2. I called prior to confirm the dress code and was told "" dress to impress, but no hoodies "". Knowing that, I told my boyfriend to leave his hoody in the car, which he did. But after being seated we spotted two other individuals with hoodies on, one being a customer and one being an employee. So that stood out to me, because it was a bit cold in the restaurant. 3. No one was available in the car parking lot, so we parked 2 blocks away, which wasn't a problem. But the convenience was having the lot close to the location, hopefully next time someone would be available. 4. Upon arriving, Security was AWESOME so very polite. Upon checking in, Staff was AMAZING. The ambiance was GREAT, Everything was Just so perfect. I did request a window seat, but was told they were all occupied, so we sat in the 2 seater high seat for more of an intimate date. 5. Customer service was BEYOND GREAT, the BUSSERS WERE SPECTACULAR. The food was SO VERY DELICIOUS AND TASTEFUL. The drinks were VERY WELL PREPARED AND MADE with LOVE.  6. The only thing that really stood out to me the most, was when the bill arrived and I was ready to formulate a tip. I said wait, and asked my boyfriend if he knew the name of our server. He said "" no "" & neither did I. Because the first thing we were asked was, would you guys like some water? Never did he introduce himself to us. So when I saw his name to be "" Alex D "" the receipt, I for sure knew he failed to tell us because my little sister's name is Alexandra and her nickname is "" Alex "" so if that name was said to me, I surely would have remembered. Hopefully, he remembers to introduce himself to his future guests. Im also in the food service | customer service business as well and customer is everything to me. You HAVE to love what you do with patience, common courtesy and hospitality. We did enjoy ourselves and this first time experience. We'll be back again. THANK YOU ALLL SO MUCHH !!"
vanessas,"Dined on April 18, 2021",1,Ive been to BK chophouse before so i was very surprised by the service. I told my waiter I was ready to order and he literally told me no then walked away! He came back 10 minutes later and was super rushed when taking my order. That set the tone for the evening and everything went downhill from there.
JustinA,"Dined on April 18, 2021",1,Service was horrible i had a reservation for 8pm and I didn‚Äôt get seated until close to 10 pm than they forgot half of our  appetizers and sides than we had to rush out because the lights turned on before we even got our food definitely will not be going back
ChloeM,"Dined on April 18, 2021",5,We had to wait online for over 30 mins after having a reservation & we never even got to go inside they made us do outdoor dinning.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 18, 2021",5,"Due to NYC COVID regulations, my friend and I had to sit in their outdoor dining area because there was only 50% capacity allowed indoors. The host/greeter was very friendly and explained this to us. I could tell he probably gets pushback often because he over-explained the situation. Their outdoor space is setup well, heat lamps that actually provide great heat. Service was on point, our waiter was attentive and so was the support staff that brought water, removed/replaced plates/knives/forks. As for the food, we had the duck tacos and lobster egg roll dumplings to start. Both were tasty, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have it again. For our entr√©e I had the salmon and my friend had the bass and we paired it with the lobster fried rice, we really enjoyed our meals. Drinks were yummy. I would definitely return."
DanieleD,"Dined on April 18, 2021",1,Made reservations a week before and was advised when we arrived we still had a long wait ahead of us ........... opted to sit outside because we drove 2 hours to get excited to taste the food. The food was overpriced and not tasty at all . Overpriced Chinese food . Lamb chops were overcooked . The server Rodney was having a bad day apparently upset he had to many tables .
AnthonyW,"Dined on April 18, 2021",5,Food and service was exceptional and the staff was attentive to our needs which provided for an overall wonderful experience

Pleasedontposthis,"Dined on April 17, 2021",3,"Wonderful staff, incredible safety measures, lame food? Hate to say it because the staff was awesome but we expected much more from the food prep. Lobster rice not much lobster or taste. Dumpling very thick dough and simple.  Buns were very tasty, but needed a tiny bit of crunch to keep it from tasting like beef stew in a blanket.  Mash potatoes were interesting but nothing I would order again. Shrimp was not too deeply fried which was nice and very plentiful. I did love the bacon it was amazing! Perhaps we should have got a steak instead of the apps."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 17, 2021",4,"Great food and great service, would expect more from the wine list ."

melissat,"Dined on April 15, 2021",4,"Food was great although my steak was overdone. I ordered a Grilled Filet Mignon, to be cooked medium and it was brought out over cooked :( Otherwise the rest of our food was great. Service and drinks were good as well. Overall had a good experience!"
BrookeR,"Dined on April 15, 2021",5,Brooklyn Chop House was in a beautiful neighborhood in NYC with delicious food. I highly recommend the lamb gyro dumplings and the short rib bao buns. The cucumber lime cocktail was delicious! There was a fun crowd & I saw a few birthday dinners there. The menu is a little pricey but it was worth the delicious food. My only complaint was that we were sat at a 2 personal bar stool table which was a little uncomfortable but only a minor inconvenience. The staff was so nice & made sure our water was always filled and our orders were taken care of. Overall a really delicious place would definitely go back.
ConnorJenkinss2,"Dined on April 15, 2021",3,"The vibe was great, nice setting & great service from the waiters, but the menu & the food was not what I expected. The menu seems a bit unique for a steakhouse, and my food wasn‚Äôt as flavorful as I preferred."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 14, 2021",5,The food was delicious and service was excellent.

Michelle,"Dined on April 12, 2021",5,"I enjoyed my dining experience at Brooklyn Chop House! The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. I was disappointed that they were out of my favorite seaweed, but that gives me a reason to return."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 11, 2021",1,Horrible from start to finish. I‚Äôm not a complainer or one to leave reviews. However I must today. Even with a reservation which they take your credit card to book the reservation you still have to wait. I reserved indoor dinning and was told due to the time they won‚Äôt be able to give me a seat inside even though they are the ones who made me wait. We sat outside and the waiter was abrupt and off putting. We were served appetizers and waited and hour and a half for our main course. The steak wasn‚Äôt all that great. The mash potatoes and broccoli were very good. But the time we got our food they were closing and we felt we had to rush to eat. Don‚Äôt recommend.
DavidR,"Dined on April 11, 2021",5,Service was friendly and prompt. Food was amazing.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 11, 2021",4,"We made reservations for inside but unfortunately we were told seating for inside was an hour wait, so we had no choice but to do outdoor dining."
TanishaC,"Dined on April 11, 2021",5,As always the food is amazing as well as the service. I enjoy the ability to share the plates with everyone so we can all get a taste. Come with your wallets ready as this requires some coins but it‚Äôs worth it
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 11, 2021",4,"Went here on a date after a spa session. We had reservations and still had to stand on a long line... that was annoying. Once we were seated we had to be moved because the table was wobbling..üôÑ but once we settled in everything was good. I had the filet mignon and broccoli, it was good but just a little spicy... my date had the steak which was also very good. Their drinks were good... and the cheese cake was awesome."
ChrisL,"Dined on April 11, 2021",5,Great for a nice date night! The filet mignon beef and broccoli was superb.
ShawntneH,"Dined on April 11, 2021",4,Food was great. Great service! It was even better to see Majority black young and old.

NadiaA,"Dined on April 10, 2021",5,Brooklyn Chop House never disappoints... The food and my steak are always consistent and in point...   Really a great place for dinner.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 10, 2021",1,"This was a dinner date for my girlfriend‚Äôs birthday. The restaurant was notified but never acknowledged the occasion. There were bugs in my water (there was plastic over the glass, so the bugs came from the water pitcher used for all patrons). The food was not that great, and way over priced for what we ate (a side plate of steamed, flavorless bok choy was $22, for example). I also understand covid time restrictions, but a 1 1/2 hour limit on a steakhouse dinner is quite the rush! Very disappointing experience overall."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 9, 2021",3,Birthday dinner for 6 guest
SharG,"Dined on April 9, 2021",5,Highly recommend this place. I celebrated my birthday here  and had a wonderful time.

Steve,"Dined on April 7, 2021",3,The food was basic nothing special. The steak was extra fatty. Drinks were good. We were seated instantly which is good. Overall just an OK experience.
ChristianF,"Dined on April 7, 2021",5,"Went there with my fianc√©, we never have a bad experience"
LJ123,"Dined on April 7, 2021",4,"the food was okay , the meats need better seasoning . for it to be a chop house the meats aren‚Äôt seasoned well . and very over priced for the amount of food"
DianeS,"Dined on April 6, 2021",2,"Smoke House drink was disappointing, no smoke?  Vegetable fried no flavor.  Table too small for dishes ordered."
MichelleM,"Dined on April 5, 2021",4,"Food was great, service a lil slow but that could be because it was Easter Sunday ambiance was beautiful. Overall a good experience."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 4, 2021",4,The dumplings and Appetizers were delicious. The Caesar salad is  amazing... highly recommend! The fried rice was hard but had good flavor. Be aware that you will have to wait even with a reservation. Pulled up and the reservation line was around the corner. Was able to get seated faster (around 10 minute wait) because we were a party of 2 and willing to to dine outside.
Fatima,"Dined on April 4, 2021",5,"My new favorite spot. I‚Äôve been here almost weekly since February. The food is phenomenal! The chicken satays and a drink are my after work go to meal. Lovely place to head for a date, special occasion or like me, every day dining. You will not be disappointed- unless you don‚Äôt have a reservation!"
KattyM,"Dined on April 4, 2021",3,"The food here is mediocre, especially for the price. The service is not great. We had a reservation for 7:15pm, arrived at 7:08pm and had to wait in line, outside, for 30mins to be seated. While I understand that Covid restrictions impact the dining experience, but you know what your capacity is, why overbook to have people waiting online. My biggest pet peeve, was that the line was being managed the same way NYC clubs are. It's all about who you know to get moved up on the line and get seated first - which at that defeats the purpose of a reservation."
IhsanR,"Dined on April 4, 2021",1,Not the environment I expected more like a club environment and very very small. Ordered fried wontons and spring rolls. (Yuck) the chicken in the wontons were like the Chinese store from the neighborhood. Overpriced intense aggressive environment. The French fries weren‚Äôt fresh cut they were chicken shack fries that Cost 1.00 but they charge you 10 dollars for them. The spring rolls were greasy as hell and the grease taste like it wasn‚Äôt change in the past 2weeks. My gf got the salt and pepper shrimp and the batter was like a regular  Chinese  store with the same quality. It‚Äôs overpriced and over hype! If you‚Äôre going to drink and listen to music and look at people cool but don‚Äôt go there to eat because that ain‚Äôt the place. My NY strip steak was horrible you‚Äôre better off going to longhorn steakhouse. The soda was flat as hell these people can‚Äôt even get simple basics down like fresh cut French fries. Brooklyn chop house is a scam I felt like I got robbed. This is the god honest truth go there with sweat pants on and a hoody nothing to dress up for. Very very small place and tight people next to you in your conversation breathing on you. There‚Äôs also a line in the front with a bouncer and metal detectors. C‚Äômon man are you serious?
NazingaB,"Dined on April 4, 2021",4,The food wasn‚Äôt a great as expected. This is the second time dining here and the 1st visit the food was amazing. I ordered the same dishes the second time and not one dish taste as great as the first time. I even had to send a dish back to have it remade.
ChereseJ,"Dined on April 3, 2021",1,"We arrived early for our reservation. It was FREEZING outside. They had us standing outside on a line for 30 minutes WITH a reservation. We left and they still billed my card $40.00.  We asked several people, why we had to wait so long in the cold. They told us to just wait on the line.. won‚Äôt go back"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 3, 2021",5,"The wait staff was incredible, the appetizers were so so (2 out of 4 we ordered were amazing), the entrees were very good (steak was cooked to perfection). Would definitely return for another date night some time soon for sure!"
BritL,"Dined on April 2, 2021",3,This is my second time here I returned of course because the food is good. However the service is horrible I had a reservation at 730 didn‚Äôt get settled until almost 840. On top of that they don‚Äôt allow you to wait inside so we had to stand in the cold becasise the car was parked in a garage not close by. They kept pushing us to take a table outside even though I specifically asked for indoor on the reservation. Some people from the reality show love and hip hop where in there asking for a table for 13 so I believe they were bumping peoples reservations to accommodate them. Once we sat the waiter rushed us to order food and appetizers at the same time because we could only be at the table for 90 minutes. If I hadn‚Äôt drove all the way from Philly for it I would have left.
Mrhumble113,"Dined on April 2, 2021",5,Had wonderful time the food was on point
JeremyC,"Dined on April 2, 2021",5,Great restaurant the service was excellent and the food was prepared well. would definitely return again
PurpleButterflies,"Dined on April 2, 2021",5,"Beginning at the front door, our party was extended the 'Welcoming Arm of Outstanding Dining Adventure""!! We were formally greeted by the staff along with a dedicated ""birthday greeting"" for our guest of honor and main reason for our celebration. In my opinion, we had premium table seating and our server 'was flown in directly from Paris' just to serve us!! Although I know this was a joke, he was SUPER ATTENTIVE and so very helpful with honest suggestions on the menu items! I must give a shout out to the Bartender on duty -- all of our drink orders were on point!!!!!! The entire evening was magical; the dishes were picture perfect, yet succulent. I am so happy that we chose this restaurant and I will return next time I visit the city!!! Our table was uniquely blessed by a visit from the Owner which was more than a welcomed surprise!!! Much success and blessing bestowed on you, your business and all of its qualities and genuine service."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 28, 2021",4,"Even though we had reservations, we had to wait on a line outside to get into the restaurant. Ambiance was nice inside. Waiter took 25 min to take our order. The food was great. The waiter knew it was one of our birthdays so he brought over dessert and candle for us, we thought i was a nice gesture and on the house but was surprised to see it slapped on the bill although we didn‚Äôt ask for it."
Ceec,"Dined on March 28, 2021",3,Disappointed with this Visit. It Was my birthday and nothing special was really Done. I feel like I could‚Äôve had a much better time somewhere else. The food was good but not as good as the other times I‚Äôve came. It was just chaotic inside which is understandable as it‚Äôs been like this most places since the pandemic. But yea I feel like service could‚Äôve been more friendly. The appetizers weren‚Äôt great.  I probably won‚Äôt come back unless it‚Äôs for take out because the prices don‚Äôt match the experience.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 27, 2021",5,It was wonderful! I would come over & over again.

Matt,"Dined on March 27, 2021",4,"Fantastic place! Pretty pricey. The food was absolutely delicious, and it's a cool place with a pretty good vibe. We would love to come back.  Only thing is, considering our total came to $160 for a usual three-course meal and the items we ordered were on the cheaper side of the menu, there are certainly comparable places for a lower price even in the city.   If you're okay with paying for a bit more of an expensive meal than you'd likely expect, definitely recommend!"

Ginah,"Dined on March 21, 2021",3,"I was disappointed on a few things, I saw employees wearing their mask below their noses.  I am an author and writer for many television shows and requested in my pre deposit for a private table.  That wasn‚Äôt even addressed when I came in.  So I guess if you are not a rapper/actor you are not given the same crudit√©s.  My lamb was extremely fatty, not like how you keep some fat on for flavor more like a poor cut of meat.  My lobster dumpling did not taste like lobster was in it, and was brown.  I mean you are paying for the best, and I got mediocre.  I was not impressed.   I‚Äôd like to say one thing positive... but can‚Äôt.  The neighboring table broke a glass, which ended up on my side, which twice I requested for someone to clean, both times glass chards were left ... what can I expect?  Lastly, I ordered the cucumber mint and it was just a swallow.    At this point, I‚Äôm all set.  I‚Äôve seen my friends come through people in the Industry and the treatment they got was exceptional.  I can‚Äôt imagine what the general public eats here and the non attention they get.  Oh ... yes I can, because it happened to me.  Lol"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 19, 2021",4,The food was very good. I felt rushed. The waiter was literally standing over us. They were trying to grab the plates even when we still had food on them.

JAMc,"Dined on March 15, 2021",5,"Boukary was our server. He was so knowledge, kind and attentive. He made the evening fun and his French accent is a definite advantage. The food was great. The outside seating was spacious and comfortable with outdoor heating. Overall, excellent!"
Benny,"Dined on March 15, 2021",5,Love this place I will be back !!!!! Ok  food was amazing and felt very safe during COVID-19
SAFPhoto,"Dined on March 14, 2021",3,There was a wait even with reservations. We were offered to be sat outdoors in the heated tint versus waiting outside to be seated.   The food was plentiful for 2 and the price was great.  not too fond of the taste of the food.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 14, 2021",5,"Love love loved my food and ambience !! Arrive 30 min before your reservations ! There was a crazy line, my evening was worth the wait.  Great birthday spot ."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 13, 2021",5,AMAZING!!! Everything from security outside to the desert was OUTSTANDING!
AshP,"Dined on March 13, 2021",2,Overall I expected my experience to be a lot different for my birthday. Half of our food took a long time to come out in which people were left watching everyone eat. Then to top it off the waiter thought he was slick and charged us an extra $130 when the correct amount to take off each card was written on the paper. When we addressed the situation the next day we were told the machine malfunctioned but if we did not call they would of never gave us our money back! Malfunction my behind! Your waiter tried to steal extra money. I won‚Äôt be returning here.
ChrystalQ,"Dined on March 13, 2021",5,We are from New Orleans and decided to celebrate my Husband's birthday here. He had steak and I had lamb chops. They were absolutely perfect.  The salt & pepper lobster bites were delicious as was the duck tacos.... Expected a larger class for the price that the drinks were but they were good as well.  The Valet team was great and made us feel like we were Stars!!!
NadiaR,"Dined on March 13, 2021",5,Softest steak I‚Äôve had this far and i loooove steak ! Lobster fried rice was amazing !!! And the cheesesteak dumplings were yummy ! My drink mixed to perfection !! I‚Äôll def be coming back !
KarenS,"Dined on March 13, 2021",5,"Food always amazing , My favorite is the chicken satay and the salt and pepper lobster! The servers are top notch and high class , you get a full experience while at the chophouse , i love the rose spritzer"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 12, 2021",5,"Ambiance, music and service was an A+! The food was very middle of the road but visually appealing.   Imagine getting Asian takeout from a bodega-Chinese Food place on the corner in one of the boroughs .... minus the styrofoam packaging - add some garnish and give it a cool name or a fusion east meets west mix. The taste is very meh.   The food visually appealing and novel (insert pac-man dumplings here). Great ideas, poor execution and totally lacking in taste.   Definitely go for the ambiance, music and service but don‚Äôt expect to be wowed by the taste. You‚Äôll be disappointed. I gotta say, I‚Äôll be back! üôåüèΩ"
AshleyT,"Dined on March 12, 2021",1,My food wasn‚Äôt cooked according my liking (medium well)  I had to wait for another steak order that took 30 mins that tables weren‚Äôt big enough I was put in a corner very small on my anniversary. It was a unorganized with the seating. The server was okay. Not a good experience for the first time wouldn‚Äôt recommend it

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 8, 2021",4,Food is excellent. Found it a bit disturbing that I had to wak through what appeared to be metal detectors after I made it past a bunch of security.
ReyRey,"Dined on March 8, 2021",5,The service was excellent as well as the food. Everyone was very polite and courteous. My wife and I felt very comfortable and safe at the restaurant.   It adhered to COVID-19 guidelines. We will be returning again.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 8, 2021",5,Perfect dining
Tiffany,"Dined on March 8, 2021",5,"Everything was great, but the lobster fried rice was over priced as the lobster pieces weren‚Äôt even half the size of a dime but smaller.  Besides that, the food was ahmazing!!"
TechnicianTheDJ,"Dined on March 7, 2021",5,Beijing Chicken was incredible with a side of Bok Choy
NicoleP,"Dined on March 7, 2021",5,Well let me say I was at annoyed at first Bc we had to wait outside but the host was amazing very fun and polite  The food was delicious the drinks were the bomb  The place was live not boring oh yeah the music definitely very good. I‚Äôm so glad I came and I will be returning

MaryR,"Dined on March 7, 2021",4,"Wonderful food and service however I couldn't relax and enjoy it due to the 1 1/2 hour limit.  We skipped desert as we ran out of time.  In addition I didn't see the sense in the ""partitions"" as they were small but the tables were spaced far enough apart.  Overall very good and I will probably go back once covid is under control."
Celine,"Dined on March 7, 2021",5,Daniele our server was excellent! He explained everything and went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. I will definitely be returning!

Vbangin11,"Dined on March 6, 2021",2,Horrible. Don‚Äôt waste your money here.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 6, 2021",5,My Boyfriend and I enjoyed everything about this establishment. From the food to the service everything was perfect. Thank you so much and we will definitely be returning.
takeyaf,"Dined on March 5, 2021",3,Even though I made a reservation for indoor dining I was told that they were at capacity indoors and there was 5 people ahead of me waiting for indoor dining however the 3 people that were online before me never came back outside they were seated inside and the people that were online after me were not seated outside! I felt judged but I will not get to that. However the food was decent but because it was so cold outside I was not able to enjoy it. Will I return I dont know.
Chrissie,"Dined on March 5, 2021",5,It was fabulous! The food is amazing ! Everything was wonderful. No complaints over here. Definitely representing Brooklyn to the fullest
Lexia12,"Dined on March 4, 2021",3,We were seated at a table that was close to the door the temperature in the restaurant was completely uncomfortable and took a while to get used to . It was freezing . The food was good the service was average .
JasonW,"Dined on March 4, 2021",5,"Outstanding food, drinks, and service.  I really appreciated the advice on food choices...especially the shrimp appetizer and the lamb chops.  I could have swam laps in my martini!  The only suggestion would be to turn the music down some, but maybe I'm just getting old ;)"
ToniaP,"Dined on March 3, 2021",5,"Food amazing, service impeccable, ambiance outstanding. Worth every penny spent. Convenient Parking right next door."

TamaraI,"Dined on March 2, 2021",5,Brooklyn girl by heart and this place is the perfect representation of the types of food and ambiance we love!
OnjaliqueT,"Dined on March 1, 2021",2,This restaurant is not an upscale ambiance as advertised. There are two metal detectors upon entry which still in fact made me weary about if the restaurant is safe. They accept any attire it is not formal at all. People wear there everyday clothes in there.
Lilli,"Dined on March 1, 2021",1,"Overall dining experience was absolutely horrible! When booking my reservation I specifically selected that I wanted standard seating not outdoor because it was way to cold to be outside. My reservation was for 5:30. I arrived at about 5:15 and when I spoke to the hostess she was very rude. She told me my reservation wasn‚Äôt until 5:30 which I had told her when I first mentioned that I had a reservation. She then told me that even with my reservation and selection of indoor dining that she could not accommodate it and I had to either sit outside or wait 45 mins because she had sat ppl who came before me. So I politely asked her if everyone she just sat had a reservation for indoor dining and she replied no they did not, it‚Äôs first come first serve. That‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous! So me a someone who made a reservation and selected indoor seating would have to wait 45 mins past my reservation because she decided to accommodate someone else! Very unprofessional!   Against my better judgement I decided to wait because my husband wanted to try this place out. BIG MISTAKE! Once we were finally seated at about 6:15 the waiter was not attentive. The food came out cold and it did not taste good at all. At that point I was just over it and decided to cut dinner short and leave. I will never return back to this establishment nor will I ever recommend it to anyone!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 1, 2021",3,Our waiter and food were amazing. However; we were not valued as customers by the host. We entered early and were asked to wait in the entry way of a building and just left there even after they accepted other customers. Not a good first expression.
CrystalH,"Dined on February 28, 2021",2,Service was good food ok wait was long overall I enjoyed the drinks was great

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 27, 2021",4,They make you wait outside even if you have a reservation ...   I waited for 30 mins on a line ...   Despite that everything else was great
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 27, 2021",5,Celebrating success. I come here often and I brought my friend because she‚Äôs never been and I was celebrating her . Everything was great the food and service was amazing !
TeeDinesOut,"Dined on February 27, 2021",5,The food is always amazingly delicious. It was a wonderful splurge meal for our anniversary.  It was a little disappointing to be outside despite making reservations a month in advance. The waitstaff was as pleasant as could be. Top notch efforts to make everyone comfortable.
TonayG,"Dined on February 27, 2021",1,"For my first time it was horrible ! For 4.3 stars , high end restaurant,  for hair to be in my friend food was CRZY ! Could of went to Ricardo‚Äôs for all that. God is good free meal on them for their mess up & I ended up giving my food to someone in need ."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 26, 2021",5,It was my first time and I really enjoyed myself the food was great. I really appreciated that the host accommodated me so that I could eat inside and not outside. The dining table for 2 can be a little bigger for the space necessary to hold food and drinks. Other wise it was a very nice evening.
AngelaC,"Dined on February 26, 2021",5,"It was an awesome experience food, drinks and appetizer was awesome so was our waiter thank you so much"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 24, 2021",5,The food was absolutely amazing
LatifaT,"Dined on February 22, 2021",4,"Dining at Brooklyn chop house was an awesome experience with the exception of the strict seating policy. We were 10 minutes past the grace  for our reservation and had to dine outdoors, however I still enjoyed the dining experience. Food and service was excellent."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 21, 2021",1,"I came to celebrate my birthday. I had a 9:15pm reservation for indoor dinning. I called at 6pm to confirm the table. When I arrived at 9:05pm there was a line around the corner. I assumed it was for to go orders but was told it was the line to get inside. That seemed strange but joined the line like everyone else. As I‚Äôm waiting online with my friends the ‚Äúhost‚Äù keeps coming to ‚Äúcheck‚Äù on us but nothing is really happening. While on line we see the ‚Äúhost‚Äù taking people behind us off of the line and escorting them inside. It is obvious as to what is going on. I felt disrespected at the fact that on a cold night in the city that I had to wait over an hour outside on line for a reservation that I showed up to on time for while the girls with fake bodies and fake influence wake inside. No me and and my friend might not be those type of girls, we are hard working gainfully employed women. So when I asked what is taking so long I was told people weren‚Äôt getting up and that the Owners didn‚Äôt want to rush people to dine within the 90 minute time frame.   We were finally seated it was 10:20. We were told we to had to rush and order our food because they close at 11pm. So because they weren‚Äôt rushing the people inside that exceeded the 90 minute time frame, my party now has to rush to eat and socialize in less than an hour. How does that work? I‚Äôm so confused. In addition, the waiter told us due to it being so late we could not order any steaks, which was the reason why we came. Also they didn‚Äôt have any more soft shell crab or apple fried wontons. Talk about highly disappointed. The night was a total disaster.   Lastly we ordered some food to go. At 11pm they are looking at us like we were are stupid because we are still sitting there. Told the server that we never received our to go order that was place at 10:45 according to my receipt. Come to find out the kitchen never made the order and guess what the kitchen is now closed and the chef left. Like give me a break"
MarshaL,"Dined on February 21, 2021",2,"Even though you have a reservation you still have to wait hours in line just to get in, once your in, if it‚Äôs close to closing; now they are rushing you, not worth the wait, but with all that said the food was excellent, if you don‚Äôt mind the wait outside, then it‚Äôs okay."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 21, 2021",1,"My friends and I had a reservation for 8pm on a Saturday night. We arrived on time. As I approached a noticed a line which wrapped around the corner. I was then told by security that was the line for reservations. The entire statement makes zero sense. We didn‚Äôt get inside until 9:15. We waited on line, in the cold, for an hour and 15mins. Tables are not 6ft apart, but there are dividers. If you‚Äôre accepting reservations and patrons STILL have to wait on line outside to get in you‚Äôre doing something terribly wrong. I would never give them my business again."
Mich,"Dined on February 21, 2021",1,Although the food was good the wait was horrible. There should be a better way to accommodate customers as they wait to be seated. It was unorganized to me.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 20, 2021",5,Absolutely loved this restaurant. Service was amazing. Beyond friendly. Food is incredible. Such a great vibe. Can‚Äôt wait to go back.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 20, 2021",3,"The food was good , customer service was good. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like when you make reservations they should give you an option to dine in and out . As well the utensils, napkins and stuff we use to eat and drink with was on the sidewalk and it wasn‚Äôt cover. Anybody could walk by and touch it"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 19, 2021",5,Great  experience

KaiW,"Dined on February 18, 2021",3,"Brooklyn Chop House is mediocre at best. The food & drinks has the potential to be excellent, however there's something missing - I don't know if it's due to COVID, but it did not meet my boyfriend or my standards. Especially for the steep price. We will not be returning any time soon."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 15, 2021",5,"Valentine‚Äôs Day! Open table gave me the option for either Standard or Outside dining.  Waiter tried to sit me and my Valentine outside- and I was not happy about that. I understand tops the circumstances- but if I chose Standard- seat me according. After voicing myself- I was seated inside. I was happy. I told my waiter that I have a Peanut Allergy. He was on point with my food! Although we waited 1 hour for our food- it was a great experience. We mingles and talked to our neighbors sitting next to us. The music was PERFECT, and after talking and stalling time- our food came out. It was delicious!"
TiffanyM,"Dined on February 15, 2021",1,"I was very surprised by the level of service. The food was 2 hours late (for a appetizer). When the entree came, the food was overcooked and not tasty. I was eager to eat there and ended up disappointed. For the price point, this is not acceptable."
shawn,"Dined on February 15, 2021",1,They had a cold outdoor dining setup. Also it wasn‚Äôt a lot of space between tables. The Valentine‚Äôs menu was a set price and didn‚Äôt have certain items on the menu which basically made u order things that you didn‚Äôt want.
Niya,"Dined on February 15, 2021",1,The wait for food was ridiculous although I understand how busy it was because it was Valentine‚Äôs Day 3 hours waiting for food that‚Äôs not right at all that is unacceptable. Most people got up and left.

EricaB,"Dined on February 14, 2021",4,I reserved a table for a pre- Valentine‚Äôs Day dinner for two. We were seated outside in the tent. I initially had no objections to the seating arrangement until the staff started adjusting the outerliner of the tent. The area became really cold despite having heaters inside. A hostess said there was nothing to be done about the issue. I would give the restaurant a solid 4out of 5. The food and drinks were very tasty. The hostess was nice. I didn‚Äôt understand why they began to tamper with the liners while guest were occupying the outdoor dining area.
PatreceR,"Dined on February 14, 2021",3,"The food was ok. The lobster fried rice was really good. The service was good, staff is very kind and attentive. It is very noisy in there and the ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù is trash. For the price, not worth it. Drinks are super strong as well."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 3, 2021",4,"The service was great. My husband‚Äôs steak was outstanding. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is that the tent was not fully strapped in. So anytime a strong gust of wind blew, the sides would rise up. They have a lot of heat inside so I guess it balances out. Overall, best outdoor heated dining yet!"
JTLong,"Dined on January 31, 2021",5,The food was great! Very satisfied with the service and I visited on my birthday so that made the experience very special. It‚Äôs outdoor dining so dress warm!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 31, 2021",5,The food was amazing. I‚Äôm always cold and although we ate outdoors the heated lamps enabled me to remove my fur and be truly comfortable. Service was excellent. Hubby and I enjoyed ourselves.
Stephsosassy,"Dined on January 29, 2021",5,This is my second time coming and I will say it was better than I remembered. The wonton appetizer and shrimp were great. The waiter Tony recommended the lamb chops for main entree. OMG!!!! Delicious. Definitely a great choice with every bite. Lamb tends to be tough. We ordered it medium and it was perfect. üëåüèæüëåüèæ with crab fried rice. drinks were good the old fashioned was respectable and despite having to sit outside we weren‚Äôt cold thank goodness. Coming back just for dinner with a friend as opposed to a large group setting allowed me to actually enjoy the food more and it was great üëçüèæ
Hexadesmal,"Dined on January 27, 2021",5,"The heating lamps are HOT!  This is the best outdoor dining experience the food was warm the entire time I was there. I didn't have to rush to eat my food before it became cold from wind outside like other restaurants.    The fried rice is very good and a large portion, I recommend sharing with 4 people. The colorado lamb chops (my dinner) were excellent, prepared medium rare with the mint olive dipping sauce.   The best dessert is apple fried wontons with vanilla ice cream, I highly recommend this dessert. The crispy wontons with warm (nearly hot be careful) apple filling with one scoop of vanilla ice cream. It is the perfect finish to this exceptional dining experience."

KH1127,"Dined on January 18, 2021",3,The outdoor dining wasnt very appealing.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 17, 2021",4,"Overall Good Experience, the only draw back was being seated. I had reservations for 7:45 and wanted seated until around 9pm. Then we were rushed to order drinks and food before the kitchen closed. It was just insane to me thar I was rushed after waiting patiently while I had reservations. The food and service was good once finally being seated."

MattH,"Dined on January 6, 2021",1,Belligerent man drinking outside drink in the middle of restaurant. Extremely volatile and scary. Restaurant did nothing. What‚Äôs the point of having a bouncer if not going to do anything? 300 dollars down the drain.
JamisonS,"Dined on January 5, 2021",5,"It's obvious everyone is doing everything possible to make sure safety and health of their staff and customers is their top priority. Food, drinks and staff was top notch."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 26, 2020",5,"Had Christmas dinner there with my sister and friend. Everything was perfect, I felt and super warm. Entire staff wore gloves & masks and the table setting was individually wrapped in plastic to reduce the possibility of any contamination. You MUST order the sea bass with garlic potatoes and Sour Diesel to drink! You‚Äôll thank me later :-)"
thaiflip92,"Dined on December 25, 2020",5,"Christmas Eve my friend and I returned to this spot. This time the outdoor seating improved with the addition of heaters and more insulation.  We had different servers and bus boys and the staff were more strict with the timing.  We ordered the same items as last time: Beijing chicken, vegetable fried rice and bok choy. All three did not disappoint. I ordered the kung pao chicken and the red velvet frose. The kung pao chicken was good but spicy in a tasteful way. The red velvet frose was pretty good but it gave me a huge brain freeze.  Everything was quick from service to food."
Leee,"Dined on December 24, 2020",5,excellent staff and food. my waiter was amazing. i cant wait to return :)

TyroneG,"Dined on December 15, 2020",5,"I‚Äôd heard so much about Brooklyn Chop House from friends but hadn‚Äôt gone until this week.   It lived up to everything I heard. The food was amazing and the outside seating was perfect.   We had the lobster fried rice, lamb chops and sweet and sour chicken.  All of which were seasoned to perfection.    The drinks were great too.  All in all, I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place (I even ordered food to go the next day because it was so good)!"

KrystalR,"Dined on December 13, 2020",5,"Just wonderful. There's no surprise they are a ""dumpling house"", we got pork dumplings to start and ended up ordering many more. The crispy seaweed is amazing and goes with everything they serve. We got the porterhouse, it was delicious, lots of flavor, and a giant portion. Our sides, the ginger and garlic mash, and the shrimp fried rice was to die for. I'd go back anytime for that rice. The best part of the night was our drinks. We got the sour diesel. If cognac is your drink of choice, please try it. It is incredible. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the dumplings lol."
GlamMaverick,"Dined on December 13, 2020",3,It was just OK. Food was good. But again. Just OK. Very overrated. The Crab Soup is delish!!
AschliV,"Dined on December 12, 2020",4,Went there for my boyfriend‚Äôs birthday. It was nice even though we were outside. The food was great our waiter was great (Alex) I‚Äôm glad we ate here and we will be coming again
DeyonW,"Dined on December 6, 2020",3,It was ok... we try to order the salt and pepper lobster for 2 .... but the waiter came back and said the didn't had any..that was a disappointment..we had to get lobster tail instead and it was just ok for me.. but my girlfriend said is wasn't good..and the fry rice.. wasn't that good..
MFoodie,"Dined on December 6, 2020",3,"There was a lot of standing around in the cold awaiting the late set up of our reservation. The modified process for Covid could use some streamlining   The folks who were supposed to seat us forgot so we did more standing in the cold on the street corner   Ahead of time I advised that it was a birthday but the whole candle was forgotten with dessert.   The pancakes that we ordered we‚Äôre burnt. The food was disappointing and according to my guest has been to Brooklyn Chop house previously, this experience was not the quality of food experienced previously.   I really appreciated all the effort to put up barriers between tables. I certainly felt a lot safer.  Our waiter was excellent but struggled to keep his mask on."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 6, 2020",5,"I had been here in the warm weather and loved it, so when I heard they had heat lamps I decided to take my son for his birthday. Great set up, ventilation but protected tables. The food is amazing - we shared a bunch of small plates. And of course they have the best birthday candles in town."
Tiffany,"Dined on December 6, 2020",5,"I love this restaurant from the host, the service, the food just everything."
Leee,"Dined on December 4, 2020",5,Waiter was excellent. The only reason I took a star away was the busboys were rushing to remove items from the table it felt like they were rushing us out. And while within the time frame I had to ask the waiter if we had to leave as they had just provided us with our request round. The waiter explained we were fine and didn‚Äôt have to leave so we enjoyed our drinks and tipped bigger. Also the place was very clean and felt covid safe.
SamiraS,"Dined on December 4, 2020",5,"Amazing food, amazing service! Ambience is sexy, clean and just right. Cant wait to go back"
Francesca,"Dined on November 30, 2020",4,"service was great, our waiter was Alex. Food was delicious, especially the duck tacos, shrimp tempura, French onion dumplings, and ginger beef noodles. Would definitely recommend."
DawnP,"Dined on November 29, 2020",4,Do to covid we were rushed
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 29, 2020",4,Service was mediocre. Chicken satay was amazing.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 29, 2020",3,It was too cold outside and the heat lamps weren‚Äôt warm. I think that you should get an option whether to sit inside or outside. I had a reservation and it was 4:00 so I couldn‚Äôt understand why we couldn‚Äôt get seated inside. Yes there is a 25% capacity but no one was seated inside. Reservations are in place for a reason as well as a 90 minute table seating. That helps to monitor the 25% capacity rule and to balance it out with the time slots for each reservation. I‚Äôve been to several restaurants within the city and Brooklyn. They give you an option to sit either inside or outside and it shows whether it‚Äôs available or not. The excise we got was ‚ÄúWe only seat people outside first then when it‚Äôs full then we will seat people indoors.‚Äù I had the first reservation when they opened so I really thought my request could‚Äôve been accommodated. I was highly disappointed being that this is one of my favorite restaurants.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 28, 2020",5,"The server was great, the food was delicious, exceeded my expectations. Definitely will come back!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 25, 2020",5,The food and service were excellent.  Everything was clean and tables inside were appropriately distanced with plexi glass between them.
KayWest,"Dined on November 24, 2020",5,"Great vibe to this place! Staff are not robotic and we had a genuine good time with servers that assisted us(they get you out in 90 without feeling rushed). Ok, Peking Duck tacos. Shut Up! Perfecto! The Lamb chops are mandatory. Guests next to us raved about the satay. I can't remember the name of the drinks(probably bc I had too many:), but its a house speciality with lychee (not the martini) and strawberries topped with a dope bacardi with consistency of a mudslide? idk, tell them to hook you up and they do.   If the food is not enticing enough there were plenty of beauty girls in attendance that made things interesting. Beautiful food for beautiful people. Must do!"
MissyB,"Dined on November 24, 2020",1,"Seated in outdoor tent; it was freezing  never have had this happen at a fine dining place & they acted as if this was normal & very rude when we asked if they would take the steaks back while we ate our salads.  Remember its freezing & it would be completely cold.  They did buy us a round of drinks.  Also,  other party was very loud & smoking weed in the tent.  I don‚Äôt care if we are outside are not.  When I spend $400+ for a party of 4 I don‚Äôt want to smell weed while having dinner.  My daughter has wanted to have dinner here for the past 5 months & to say we were disappointed is an understatement."

YSLL,"Dined on November 19, 2020",2,"You should be able to choose if you want to sit inside or Outside in the fake heated tents. But they don‚Äôt. So we left even though we made reservations 3 days prior. They didn‚Äôt move us in the restaurant because they were at capacity but move another couple that came in after us inside lol yet, they was over capacity. We left to another steak house that allowed us to sit inside. This was my first time here and it was a terrible experience & first impression!"
KimberlyJ,"Dined on November 16, 2020",5,"The food was AMAZING! Loved the bok choy, the ribs, my steak was good but ive had better, the garlic and ginger mashed potatoes was soo good! All the drinks I tried were delicious. I loved it. Who wants me to take me back?"

YvetteM,"Dined on November 15, 2020",4,"Brooklyn Chop House was a great experience. Due to Covid-19 our seating was close to the door with lots of traffic back and forth allowing cold air to penetrate. Food was good, a larger portion size for the price would have been nice."
DerrickR,"Dined on November 15, 2020",2,"Didn‚Äôt like eating outside in the cold. When making the reservations for my wife‚Äôs birthday, I wasn‚Äôt given the OPTION of eating inside or outside. Upon arrival we were TOLD that we had to eat outside. If I had know prior to coming there, I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted our time. I guess the restaurant only cares about putting butts in the seats instead of the comfort of their paying customers. I understand the times that we are in, things are different. However, customer service and courtesy shouldn‚Äôt change. I suggest explaining the dining options during reservation process."

Raymondc,"Dined on November 1, 2020",2,"I had been dying to come to this restaurant since April for my birthday because all the press, hype and good reviews I had seen. I was disappointed during my first experience this past weekend. I expected the mix of asian and American steak house to be one of the most tastiest things ever, after going to other steakhouses where the taste is very bland. I expected the chicken fried rice to be more flavorful also. Aside from that I am more so disappointed the experience for the amount of money I spent. The waiter rushed us to order and did not take time to even give us a run down of the menu. The waiter would just stop by every so often to see if we are ready in a very rushing tone. I had such high expectations and am very disappointed. He did make sure to let us know we had 90 minutes to order and eat though. I know covid-19 makes everything tough and you want to sit as many people as possible to make your money, but the experience needs to better in those 90 minutes you a-lot for people to sit. My recommendation is to improve the customer service experience so that it matches the amount of press and hype received. For $182 we could of went to Benihanas for half that price and gotten a warmer experience. Outside seating was very cluttered and cold which is why we waited to be seated inside, heaters were not very effective."

MiriamD,"Dined on October 27, 2020",5,Will definitely be going back! The service was awesome.
DIron,"Dined on October 27, 2020",4,"This is a unique Chophouse with an Asian flare. Everything is meant to be shared! Even my husbands veal chop came cut into sections (although he didn't share - lol).   My daughter and I LOVE going here for dumplings! They are so unique! Lamb dumplings, philly cheesesteak dumplings, french onion soup dumplings! We share a few of these and usually a salad and always leave satisfied.   It's not an inexpensive place, on the pricier side - so expect to spend some $$$'s for the experience.   They did a fabulous job with the outside ambience. I didn't like how they told us we would have a 90 minute table time - for that price - they should give you 2 hours! They used the excuse because of how busy they were. It was a Monday night and literally tons of tables were not even filled once. It really turned us off. Plus say that on the booking/reservation site. Turned out all we needed was 90 minutes, but what were they going to do - kick us out if we weren't done eating or drinking? Bizarre!"
JohnG,"Dined on October 27, 2020",5,Dining here for my birthday was a great decision. It was great from variety of food to selection of wines just perfect for any occasion a must visit place for people dining in FI-DI.

Blue,"Dined on October 24, 2020",1,The night was okay I guess. They have heavy plexi glass barriers between each table to keep us distanced. And the group behind me knocked it over and it fell on my head knocked over our table woth our drinks and food. Like I was pretty much over the night. The very least they should have compensated our meal. They just moved our table and gave us one free shot of tequila between 3 people. We ate and left. Clothes were wet. We didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene. It was a weird accident but I‚Äôm sure it could‚Äôve been a more enjoyable experience.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 24, 2020",5,It was an amazing experience from the ambiance to the food. The server was very pleasant and accommodating. I‚Äôll definitely come back to dine again.

Fehintola,"Dined on October 17, 2020",5,"The service was extraordinary! The food was great as well, so overall a great time."
CherrylA,"Dined on October 17, 2020",5,"What an experience,  the staff was very helpful and personal. The food was excellent. It is a bit expensive,  but worth every penny. Our server Steven took our order without writing it down, and everything was correct.  We celebrated my mother's Birthday and she enjoyed the food an ambiance.  Thanks for the memories."
RBBo,"Dined on October 17, 2020",5,"The service was excellent and staff friendly. The food was good, as well."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 16, 2020",4,It was very nice. Customer service was great and they have a good menu. The porterhouse was not very flavorful for it being so expensive but the fried rice was delicious. Drinks were superb. I mentioned to the host staff that it was my guests birthday and they didn‚Äôt do anything which I guess is fine but I‚Äôve spent much less $$ at other restaurants and gotten at least a small dessert with a candle. And I actually would‚Äôve been fine to pay for it but it wasn‚Äôt even offered. Overall I would go again but don‚Äôt do a special occasion because they‚Äôre too busy to care really lol.
NatJ,"Dined on October 16, 2020",3,"The food here was GREAT!! However, I wasn‚Äôt given the option if I wanted to sit inside or outside. It was freezing cold at my table. At the end of my meal the waiter charged me an 18% gratuity and wanted another tip on top of it."
thaiflip92,"Dined on October 16, 2020",5,I returned to this spot with my friend and we were seated in the same table and even better we had the same server from previous time I ate here alone.  As promised to the server I ordered the lychee frose along with the cheeseburger dumplings so my friend can try them. We went into the entrees and ordered filet mignon and broccoli and the Beijing chicken.  Long story short both entrees were to die for.  We also ordered a side of bok choy and vegetable fried rice which serves 2 and no complaints there.  Once again service was slow because after 6pm it started to get packed and busy.  My friend got the apple wontons to go and she liked them.  We will be back.

Marcus,"Dined on October 13, 2020",4,"Great steak, nice vibe, staff was nice and all properly wore masks"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 13, 2020",5,"I surprized my girlfriend here for dinner to celebrate her 25th birthday and it was our first time at this restaurant. We had reservations for 8:30p. The service was superb. Gave me an ""invite only"" vibe like we were celebrities. Once we were seated, I was already impressed by the table set up. Plexiglass to separate tables, plastic wrapped plates & utensils, and a contactless menu QR code. I loved the atmosphere and ambiance. Very sexy, dimly lit, and music selection was dope. Jillian, our waitress, gave us the perfect rundown of what the restaurant had to offer since this was our first time here. It took us a while to decide what to order because everything looked so good. For our appetizers, we ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger Dumplings, Lobster ""Spring Roll"" Dumplings, and the Chicken Satay. Our favorite dumpling was the Bacon Cheeseburger and I loved the peanut sauce that came with the Chicken Satay. For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered the 16oz Filet Mignon (grilled medium well), I ordered the Steamed North Atlantic Bass, and we both agreed on the Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice to share between us. My steamed bass was good, but I enjoyed my girl's steak more. Our waitress checked in to make sure we were good and was enjoying our meals. She ended up informing us that we were getting a new waiter because it was time for her shift to end and she was leaving. Which didn't bother us. We just hoped our new waiter would also be good. And he was good. I wasn't able to catch his name, but he still made sure our needs were met. When it was time for dessert, I informed our waiter that we were celebrating a birthday and asked him for the Chocolate Swirl Cheesecake. My girlfriend loved everything about this restaurant and it made me very happy that I made the choice to come here. With that being said, I really loved this restaurant and I would definitely come back again and go down their menu to try different meals."

NicholeC,"Dined on October 12, 2020",2,"I ordered lobster, when it came it was rubbery. Also the mashed potatoes was too salty. When I told the server he says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs how they normally cook it.‚Äù $361 for rubbery & salty..... I think not.... severely over priced for that quality meal."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 11, 2020",3,Food was good - nothing extra great like people have referenced it to be. The outdoor seating under the tent was not bad- and the waitress was pretty nice and attentive. Overall a good experience.

Meesh,"Dined on October 10, 2020",4,The short ribs and Philly cheesesteak dumplings were great. The chicken fried this time was under cooked and hard. The Lychee froz√® is amazon

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 9, 2020",4,Date or special occasion. Definitely get dressed.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 9, 2020",3,Horrible waiting time after already booking a reservation and food was cold when arrived.
MichelleA,"Dined on October 9, 2020",5,"The safety precautions they have in place and still provide 4 star service is impeccable.  The service was on-point and please ask for Steven, very attentive and remember everything we ordered to the T. The noise level is contained where you seat by the plexiglass separating each customer even though you are outside but the ambiance with the set up makes you feel it's an extension of inside. Make sure to make a reservation but there will still be a little wait but other than the food, drinks, and great service will have you satisfied and planning your return for more!"
Piscesqueen,"Dined on October 9, 2020",5,The lamb dumplings and chicken satay were incredible.  So fresh. The service was excellent and I enjoyed the heated outdoor seating during the chilly evening. I WILL be going again!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 6, 2020",5,"It was our first time visiting BCH, a place we have been wanting to try for awhile. We realized our anniversary would be the perfect time to go and we are so happy we did. From the ambiance (outdoor dining but you get the feeling you are inside between the deck they‚Äôve built and how cozy they have it set up. Everything was clean, servers and busters wearing masks and gloves, plates and utensils came wrapped. Food was absolutely amazing and the service Tony gave us was incredible. I have this thing where anytime I go somewhere new, I always ask my server what‚Äôs their favorite thing on the menu to help me decide what to get. This time, upon arrival I told Tony we didn‚Äôt want any menus but wanted him to pick and bring his favorites/best sellers. I‚Äôm so glad we did that! After asking about our dietary restrictions and allergies, he delivered AND THEN SOME. If you go to BCH and Tony is there and you are a foodie (sorry picky eaters) I recommend doing the same. It‚Äôs really a nice surprise and everything is so amazing your going to enjoy it! Tony was so helpful, friendly, patient, and professional he truly made it an amazing night for us. We loved everything about BCH!"
DomJ,"Dined on October 6, 2020",5,"Amazing. Good , service , everything. A +++++ Tony was a magnificent server. Thank you!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 6, 2020",3,I brought my family out and it was nice but the staff needs to be trained more efficiently and properly!  My husband didn‚Äôt like how they kept coming to our table to remove the plates and things and just kept walking up on our table the whole time we where there and it wasn‚Äôt just our server that kept coming it was various of the waiters. But the food was okay for the most part!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 5, 2020",5,The food came out extremely fast and the wait was only 2 minutes the experience was amazing.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 5, 2020",5,The food  is amazing.. my favorite is the lamb chops in
LisaW,"Dined on October 5, 2020",3,Waiter was slow and it was not even that busy at first. He kept forgetting to bring us things we ask for. The food was just ok I ate there before and it was more tastier.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 5, 2020",5,"Delicious as usual. Filet mignon, shrimp fried rice, black bean chicken, garlic broccoli, lychee martini...are our favorites!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 5, 2020",5,It was great and we enjoyed the meal and staff it was a great experience. The only thing is during Covid you don‚Äôt get to experience the real atmosphere of the restaurant
DariaJ,"Dined on October 4, 2020",4,"Had 10:15pm reservations didn‚Äôt get into the restaurant until after 11pm. By the time we were ready to order our second round of drinks the bar was closed, but our server Heather was phenomenal. She brought us complimentary froze‚Äô for the inconvenience. Besides the wait we had a great time."
KimberlyB,"Dined on October 4, 2020",5,The food was so good and the customer service was excellent the price is high but it was worth it.

Queenzoey,"Dined on October 3, 2020",1,This was the worst restaurant by far I‚Äôve ever been to! All of the staff was very rude and unprofessional! Food horrible! Very salty. The own should re-evaluate their employers. Very disappointing
AlishaP,"Dined on October 3, 2020",1,"The food is overpriced, the outside seating situation is cramped & ghetto.. not how I imagined. Great staff aside from the terrible food & seating situation."

Baby,"Dined on October 2, 2020",5,EVERYTHING EXCELLENT THANK YOU
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 2, 2020",2,They told us we only had an hour and a half to eat. Took about 20 minutes to just get water. The actual entree ended up coming out wrong then took another 30minutes  to get it correct. They thought they gave us the food to realize they didn‚Äôt. The server had no idea what he was doing. He seemed confused and didn‚Äôt know the menu. The meal was mediocre. They didn‚Äôt comp us for anything.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 2, 2020",5,"Food, Service & Ambiance were all Amazing.."
MarciaC,"Dined on September 29, 2020",4,Celebrating my birthday dinner was wonderful food is amazing bartender great . But they charged me for my own slice of birthday cake that should be Complementary

SharayB,"Dined on September 27, 2020",5,"Brooklyn Chophouse was a very good decision for dinner. Wait time, food, and service was good. One hiccup was we asked for a knife from server, waiter, and hostess, they all forgot the steak knife. Yet 8 minutes later we had to ask again and finally got the steak knife. Overall it was amazing."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 27, 2020",5,Great experience. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was wonderful. The servers and waiters were such amazing people. I would recommend all of my friends and family.

DaniaJ,"Dined on September 27, 2020",5,"Our Server Tony was outstanding!!! He gave great menu descriptions and recommendations. More importantly, he got my 3 strawberry margaritas (w/ Casamigos) perfect each time!  The fish dishes were a little disappointing, not a lot of flavor. However, the dumplings (lobster), short rib bao buns, wedge salad, garlic broccoli, and shrimp fried rice was on point. Next time we will definitely get a steak (those looked on point)!  All in all...we are looking forward to returning...oh wait, the Apple Dumpling Cheesecake and Apple Wontons - delicious!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 26, 2020",5,The food was great and given the COVID-19 protocols they made provisions so that everyone might feel safe.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 26, 2020",5,"I had an amazing experience here! We had a 4pm reservation for an early Friday Night Dinner.

The Covid precautions made me extremely comfortable. I‚Äôll def be returning!"
Blaris,"Dined on September 25, 2020",5,Food was great! And the drinks were amazing ! Outside seating wasn‚Äôt the best !
SharonP,"Dined on September 23, 2020",4,Excellent food and enjoyed the alfresco dining during the Pandemic.  Only issue was that we had to Wait for our table.  We had a reservation and most Tables were empty when we Arrived.  Then strangely nearly all tables filled up but We were Not seated.  Had to ask 3 times before we Were seated.
jbunny,"Dined on September 21, 2020",5,Food is amazing. The combination of upscale Chinese food and a steakhouse works. My reason for the lack of service star is because mid meal we were asked to have our chairs switched out which I thought was uncalled for and extremely rude.
SadaC,"Dined on September 21, 2020",4,The food was great. I really enjoyed the outside eating as well
AnnaB,"Dined on September 21, 2020",4,"Loved this place! The food was great and the outside venue had a cute setup. Though the food took a longer time than expected to come out, I would highly recommend."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 20, 2020",4,"Great food, good service and setting. I would definitely go again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 20, 2020",3,There was one VERY loud table and no one asked them to be mindful of their voice levels. It was so loud I was about two tables away and could barely hear my friend. With whom we were celebrating her birthday and graduation. It was rather dark as it seemed as if the generator turned off or heating lamp so it was very cold. This wasn‚Äôt the experience I had in mind when reserving this restaurant. Especially with the noise of that table throughout dinner. Not sure if I‚Äôd return.
AshleyW,"Dined on September 20, 2020",5,"The service was amazing our server Jay was amazing, attentive and efficient!! The food and entire experience was just superb!"

TAB718,"Dined on September 19, 2020",5,My birthday dinner here was amazing! Definitely coming back. 4lb Lobster and porterhouse  steak are must haves!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 19, 2020",4,"Service was great. Steak was awesome, but fish of the day was disappointing, no fresh at all. I would recommend to get some dim sum and steak here. I guess fish just needs higher skills set and better ingredients picking."
TalikaB,"Dined on September 19, 2020",5,"Everything here is amazing. The food, the service is amazing. I recommend the onion soup dumplings and the leche martini. The duck is also excellent there is a wait due to them cooking it fresh. I highly recommend this restaurant. I go every year for my birthday and Valentine‚Äôs Day!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 18, 2020",5,It was amazing!!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 17, 2020",2,"Waited over an hour and a half for our main course and it arrived cold. Everyone around us, even customers seated 30 minutes after us go their food first. Extremely disappointed. I expect better service after spending $500 for just 2 people."
Baldguy,"Dined on September 17, 2020",5,Great creative food options. Friendly staff. Will return.
BarryR,"Dined on September 16, 2020",3,"Was there 15 minutes before our reservation and there was no table reserved. Had to wait 45 minutes till 3 other tables cleared out . Service was spotty , had to ask for water refills more than once . Outdoor dining is covered but not enclosed in any way so it was cold outside. 60 degrees with a slight breeze . Lighting was poor as well ."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 16, 2020",5,I Was Had To Wait For Seating When I Had Reservationis Other Than That Service Was Great .   THERE DUCK IS AWESOME ‚ÄºÔ∏è
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 16, 2020",5,Will need to go back once inside dining is available. The food was amazing.
FoodieReese,"Dined on September 16, 2020",4,"The food here is amazing, but with the outdoor seating the overall ambience is a hit or miss!! If you're lucky enough to sit under a gazebo then it's nice, but if you get stuck at one of the tables along the side of the building it's just kind of tacky (which is what happened with my party). We also waited a ridiculously long time for appetizers - almost an hour. The appetizers came out right before the duck and the duck itself takes about an hour to prepare. We were not charged for the appetizers and the manager eventually came to apologize for the delay which was the right thing for them to do. It was just kinda sucky because the day we went it was a tad bit chilly and we were just sitting there for an hour before getting any food, so it took away from the whole experience. The food was great when we got it, but things also cooled off quickly because we were outdoors. Indoor seating is now available for this restaurant, but was unavailable during the time we came because a basketball player had apparently reserved the inside. Go figure! All in all, I would definitely return, but only to sit indoors."
Nikkeep,"Dined on September 16, 2020",3,"If you‚Äôre looking for a young energetic vibe with good food & drink, this is the place for you.  Table set up was great for social distance dining and the restaurant was super busy die a Tuesday night.  Overall a good experience"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 13, 2020",1,"I picked this location for my sons 11th birthday. During this time you are required to make reservation in which I did for 830pm. We arrived at 813pm and checked in with a hostess who informed up that we would be called for our table shorty. We didn‚Äôt get seated until 930pm. Upon be seated we took about 10 minutes to place our, so by 940pm our order was in. We sat awaiting  our food  but it‚Äôs now 1030pm (almost a hour later) and we have been served nothing but water. Asked to speak with a manger because this was poor customer service and he gave no assistance other than if you want to leave you can. That‚Äôs no way to handle an issue with a customer."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 13, 2020",4,Food was amazing and the service was excellent!
Lovely131,"Dined on September 13, 2020",5,"Loooove the food, waiter was very pleasant, the only issue is that it was cold & windy, can't wait for inside dining. We'll DEFINITELY be returning üôÇ"
TashiR,"Dined on September 13, 2020",5,"This was my second time going to Brooklyn Chop, I went for my birthday in January and was so pleased that I went back with a friend for hers. We traveled from DC and it was well worth it, Jay was our waiter in January and again we were so please with the experiance that we stayed in touch. He actually came in on his off day to make sure our experience was just as great as the first time, this experience was actually better as we tried almost every appetizer they had to offer as well as numerous entree. The servings are already huge so you can imagine how full we were with food to take home. The dining outside is far more impressive then the outdoor dining locations I've seen as of late, theres a temperature check which definately made me feel comfortable given the state we are in, the dinnerware was wrapped in plastic and we were all socially distanced.  Jay brought over the owner who was very pleasent and accomodating, we definately enjoyed the full experience lol so much so that we went back the following day before getting on the road to come back to DC.  My friends and I definately plan on making a trip to Brooklyn Chop a monthly routine! Thanks again for great service, great food and an amazing experience!"
MarciaC,"Dined on September 13, 2020",4,Even with being outdoors it was a great experience.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 13, 2020",3,"I wasn‚Äôt impressed by the overpriced ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù food that i regretfully ate. Maybe it was the fact that I had to endure eating my overpriced take out dinner on a NYC street sidewalk that was on a slight decline (hill) or the fact that I had to rush and swallow my food quickly b4 it got cold and was no longer edible. Hmmmn it‚Äôs a toss up between the two. Nevertheless, I wasn‚Äôt sold on my experience at the BK chop house and I probably won‚Äôt go there again to spend MY OWN money."
EugeneC,"Dined on September 13, 2020",5,The service was great. The outdoor dining setup was very well done. Food was delicious and staff were extremely courteous and helpful.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 13, 2020",5,Love this place there isn‚Äôt one thing I do not like! Best around for sure if I could live there I would
Chanel,"Dined on September 13, 2020",4,Overall it was a positive experience the service was great only one of my entrees was a bit salty but everything else tasted delicious. We loved our waiter Steven he was very informative and kind.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 13, 2020",5,Dining excellence! Only words I can use to describe the experience. From the hostess to the waiters to the owner that gives you a crash course on how dumplings were made.  What excellence in service. Standards are set high at the Brooklyn Chophouse. You feel that from the second you take your seat.
Evyette,"Dined on September 13, 2020",4,"We enjoyed our dinner it was delicious, the only issue was the size of the Peking Duck. The Pastrami, Crab and Pork soup dumplings were amazing. I highly recommend the soft shell crab fried rice. The wait staff were very attentive, I will return but not order the Duck."
Keyz,"Dined on September 12, 2020",4,The food and set up was great. Our server left a bad taste. Not only did she forget our drink order twice when it came to the bill she came back to the table to mention that tip wasnt included in the bill after which I called her attention to the cash tip that was waiting for her on the table.
Iesha,"Dined on September 12, 2020",3,"Meh, it was pricey chinese food! Out door dining at this place sucks! Service was great though!!"

Shalayna,"Dined on September 10, 2020",5,It was my second time there. It was nice. And the new red velvet froz√© was so bomb.
June,"Dined on September 9, 2020",3,The small plates & appetizers are overpriced but the drinks are much better. The lychee martini is the only reason I go there.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 9, 2020",5,Very beautiful time eating at the restaurant. Highly recommended for everyone to try out. Will be attending again
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 8, 2020",5,Food was excellent with everything going on with outdoor dining they‚Äôre doing everything they can to make sure you have an excellent experience
Meek,"Dined on September 8, 2020",4,My girlfriends and I went on Labor Day and the best waiter !! Food was amazing drinks are always good !! We had a good time !! Bk chophouse never disappoints!!
ChristopherP,"Dined on September 7, 2020",5,AMAZING DRINKS AND EVEN BETTER FOOD.  THIS IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS.
ShariaH,"Dined on September 7, 2020",5,"We had Lobster fried rice, beef and broccoli, house salads, and lamb chops. Everything tasted very delicious..we sat outside due to covid restrictions bit the setup and ambiance was still there. Would definitely recommend."
KynaP,"Dined on September 7, 2020",5,The food and drinks are always amazing.  This was my husband's first time going and now he is hooked.
Keke,"Dined on September 7, 2020",5,Everything is always consistent at this place especially the chicken satay!!! We have been here at least 3 times since the pandemic and love everything!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 6, 2020",5,The best food ever ! Worth the price
Travel32,"Dined on September 6, 2020",3,"Not a bad place to dine, although not a ""must"" The service was good, it's unfortunate when you can see them being tired after being busy in their shift. Although that happens at times and it's not their fault when slammed. Our waiter was nice, but the all-star goes to the gentlemen who replenished our water/busser. Very well spoken and comforting, so much that I missed tipping him, because he clocked out for the day. The dishes are alright, the atmosphere is good and friendly. Their team is highly alert and trying to get everyone to sit and dine. Even their security is nice. Overall, great team/crew, just in my opinion food could be greater in taste."
HalimahA,"Dined on September 6, 2020",4,Everything was great. The only complaint I have is there was a faint sewage smell. I have a sensitive nose. My friend didn‚Äôt smell it tho so
HeatherW,"Dined on September 5, 2020",5,"Had an 8:30 reservation for dinner on a Friday. The scene was buzzing. It was lively and trendy. We were seated immediately after checking in. Service was 5 star as was the food. Dining during covid-19 can be difficult but Brooklyn Chophouse made it safe, enjoyable and delicious."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 5, 2020",1,"This restaurant was just ok, food was average. Didn‚Äôt taste great. We had the chicken satay & chicken lettuce wraps for appetizer. And the crispy beef & sweet and sour chicken with the chicken fried rice. Phillipe chow is definitely better to me. The waiter didn‚Äôt come around much, we were  sitting at a 2 seat table on the sidewalk which was on a hill. I wouldn‚Äôt come back again."
Sham,"Dined on September 5, 2020",5,Food and Service was excellent. The safety measures they have in place made me feel safe while dining. Best I have experienced in the city.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 5, 2020",5,"I booked here last minute for my sisters birthday, what a beautiful, accommodating experience. Toni was our waiter and he was about, attentive, personable he made us feel so good. He also allowed us to speak catch up and showed us that he was of service to us. I will come back to this restaurant. I will also refer people the chop house and hope they receive Tony as a waiter. I am so pleased with the food, the lychee martinis so happy to have such an experience in these crazy times."
Zeta,"Dined on September 5, 2020",5,Food was amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è took my best friend to dinner. I‚Äôm glad she had such a great time.
DeniseH,"Dined on September 4, 2020",5,It was ny first experience. Love it Love it. Take your Special Someone there. Take every one there.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 4, 2020",5,Amazing all around
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 4, 2020",3,"This place is cozy and the service staff are great but the food does not warrant the price tag. I feel like this place justifies their price tag with the owner‚Äôs Biggie name connect, but they should be either bringing food prices down or food quality up. It just isn‚Äôt quite there."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2020",5,"Alex was a great server, as well as the bussers. The food was brought out in a timely fashion and they continued to check on us throughout the night to make sure we had everything we needed. We‚Äôll definitely be returning in the future! Thanks again for another awesome and delicious meal!!"
TeijaS,"Dined on September 3, 2020",3,The food was ok. Definitely not worth the price in my opinion
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2020",5,It was my 45th bday celebration dinner.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 31, 2020",5,We were a little late for our reservation but within the grace period. We had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated.  The food was excellent and was worth the wait. It was the best food that I‚Äôve had in quite a while.
PatriceB,"Dined on August 30, 2020",3,It was ok the food was good and no fault of the establishment but there was a sewer smell on the street. I saw they placed small fans on some tables maybe they can place small oil diffusers in some tables.  The smell was awful. Other wise the service was great. The sanitizing was great the way the plates and utensils were set and wrapped in plastic was the best I‚Äôve seen yet since dining out.
FolaF,"Dined on August 30, 2020",4,"Great location, good food, not much of a variety in the menu!  Good drinks"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 30, 2020",5,"The service was phenomenal. Tony did a really great job! Oh, and the drinks were done perfectly. Don‚Äôt let me even start how good the food was."
DayDay,"Dined on August 29, 2020",2,Not a nice dining experience for a family with children. The outdoor seating is terrible. If it were just my husband and I our experience would have most likely been better.
MichaelP,"Dined on August 29, 2020",5,I enjoyed my time there. The food was amazing. The host was amazing she changed our seats when we ask for better seats the sitting on the streets. David was always awesome as well thank you and i will be returning soon or i may just order for delivery.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 29, 2020",5,Everything was nice and well put together thanks
GaynelleW,"Dined on August 28, 2020",5,Due to COVID they are only providing outdoor dining. The night we went it rained very bad and the wind was high they did everything they possibly could to make sure we still had a great experience. The hostess Nikki and our waiter Dave were absolutely amazing!!! They deserve a raise!!!
Thomas,"Dined on August 28, 2020",1,It took over an hour to be seated‚Äîwith a reservation. The server brought out the wrong bottle of wine‚Äîtwice. Food was a bit overpriced in my estimation. I will not be returning.
KareemJ,"Dined on August 27, 2020",5,Brooklyn Chop House is a must! Every aspect great
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 27, 2020",5,Creative and incredibly executed food! I liked the American Asian fusion. Very very tasty and great drinks! Great service too!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 27, 2020",2,"The appetizers were great but the main entrees were under seasoned, and my old fashion wasn‚Äôt good.  Also, the service could‚Äôve been better and we felt rushed to consume our food based on their newly imposed time limit."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 27, 2020",5,Food And Ambiance Was Amazing..
TakimiaG,"Dined on August 25, 2020",4,The food was good was just very annoyed that we was sitting next to a very loud group & it was very hot on the deck we felt the heat under us but overall we had a good time
ShamekiaP,"Dined on August 24, 2020",5,I loved everything about this restaurant the food and service was everything and the wait was not long this was my first time eating here but I will be going back very soon
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 24, 2020",2,Everything was perfectly average and very expensive
Foodieforeel,"Dined on August 24, 2020",4,I will definitely be returning.  I have yet to be disappointed with this restaurant.  Always an enjoyable experience.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 24, 2020",5,Service was excellent and the food was delicious! Amazing place to have an anniversary dinner!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 24, 2020",5,Everything was great but it was extremely hot (I know the restaurant has no control of the weather) on the patio but I still had a great time & would go back again.
Fortune300,"Dined on August 24, 2020",3,"Food great, but a little pricey.   Given the wrong check....over $200.00 overcharge   Possibly an honest mistake,,??  Dining should be allowed inside.  Restaurant  association should  pressure Gov Cuomo..  The Chop House followed all rules, including taking a persons temperature if they required access to a rest room."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 23, 2020",3,"We had reservations and still had to wait an hour, the outdoor dining is claustrophobic and dark, the food and service was ok nothing great, but very overpriced!"
KristinaA,"Dined on August 23, 2020",2,"This place is extremly lively and you wouldn't ever think that it was impacted by Covid. There was a line to get in but we were seated very quickly.  The followed all of the Covid protocol and there are partitions between the waitstaff and the guests.   As for the food it was just ok.  We started with the LAMB ‚ÄúGYRO‚Äù DUMPLINGS  and the Peking Duck Tacos. the Dumplings were good the tacos were awful. They were dry. Then we ordered black bass and the seabass. The black bass was good but the seabass was dry  Our waitier took a while to get our drinks. Then when we tried to order a second round  and he forgot my glass of wine so I just cancelled it.  Overall, maybe their steak dishes would have been better choice;  but overall I was unimpressed."
JaniceA,"Dined on August 22, 2020",5,"I loved the service ,Anthony and Leo were great. I truly enjoyed my birthday dinner I will return with the rest of my family. CHEERSü•Ç"
CeCeH,"Dined on August 22, 2020",5,Jaiquan was excellent!  He was very attentive and patient during a time when the restaurant was extremely busy.  Great service!
EvelynV,"Dined on August 21, 2020",5,I always  enjoy myself and waitress  Heather  was very attentive  to us.   Kudos to  her‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 20, 2020",5,Kudos to my server Boukary.  We shared some stories about his hometown in Paris.   He was very attentive and accommodating.  Asked for my drink right away and there it was!!! Couldn‚Äôt ask for better service.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 20, 2020",5,"The food and service were good, only downside that it was pretty dark. There was barely any light to see my food. Otherwise, definitely a great time. We‚Äôll be back next week."
AyannaH,"Dined on August 20, 2020",2,The manager ignored our group when we requested to change waiters. Our waiter was rude and condescending. Not very accommodating or Hospitable. I try to support Black owned businesses but the service is always terrible. I'll continue to Go to Mr. Chow. They will keep getting my patronage for another 20 yes. Not Brooklyn Chop House.
Victoria,"Dined on August 19, 2020",5,Great service from our waiter tony he was amazing had some cool recommendations and we had a great time
JohnS,"Dined on August 19, 2020",5,Brooklyn chop is an amazing place and if you are a steak person this is where you should go!
JaimeR,"Dined on August 18, 2020",1,Such a terrible experience I feel like a fool cause this is the second time happening to me what‚Äôs funny I had a bad experience in the day two weeks prior so no matter what time I guess this establishment is not efficient on catering to their customers not only I was seated over an hour after my appointment I was informed I had a time limit to eat my food if I wanted to rush my meal I would of joined a pie eating contest but cool I wasn‚Äôt mad at the messenger definitely asked for the manager twice and didn‚Äôt even come to my table what an unprofessional move the lamb chops were over cooked aswell as the steak... to add on I had hopes for a froze but once again the machine was frequently used or broken but that‚Äôs the 3rd time on a completely different visit I couldn‚Äôt get a frozen drink... I was reimbursed for the meats which in my opinion was mandatory  But thanks for the attempt to be kind It‚Äôs just that I order lobster friend rice  And there was no lobster in the rice  Which you did reimburse me for as well  But I didn‚Äôt care about the money at this point I was with someone who never been and honestly would never go back...me and my co workers paid a champagne fee sometime mid July and and paid an extra 10 (75) to bring in don julio 1942 we were planning to make reservations for this weekend 8 plus guest I wanted to do the same only time with two champagne fees It‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt think you guys care or appreciate our business due to you guys will continue to be booked every day since theres some hype because apparently people like to take pictures of the meal unlike me which I choose to eat good luck guys
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 18, 2020",5,Enjoyed ourselves
EquanaP,"Dined on August 17, 2020",4,This restaurant was amazing. Love it every time I attend it. The service was excellent.
luv2eat,"Dined on August 17, 2020",5,Always excellent service. Food was fabulous.  Really had a great time
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 16, 2020",5,Our waiter Steven was wonderful
StephonC,"Dined on August 16, 2020",5,You have to go and try everything. The LSD package is a good starting point.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 15, 2020",5,Our waitress name was Steven. He delivered awesome customer service. The atmosphere was very comfortable and diverse. I will definitely refer my friends and family there. The Brooklyn chip house definitely has a returning customer. THANK YOU GUYS!
RandB,"Dined on August 15, 2020",5,Food was excellent - Steven provided excellent service
LaLa323,"Dined on August 14, 2020",5,"Everyone was wonderful and very attentive.  I was with 2 girlfriends and we each chose a dumpling and side.  The PacMan, Lobster and April dumplings were delicious.  The Mayo Shrimp, Shrimp Fried Rice and Broccoli were just as delicious.  Our drinks were great: Lychee Martini, Rose Spritz and the Brooklyn Dream.  This was my 3rd time there and I‚Äôm definitely going to be there a 4th, 5th, 6th time and more!  BTW - the Red Velvet Cheesecake - Bomb!"
JermaineSS,"Dined on August 13, 2020",1,"Why make a reservation when the local celebrity comes in and skips you right away?! Food was salty, all of the meals and apps. I will say once seated the workers seemed attentive to us, which didn‚Äôt make this my most expensive worst meal ever.  Also, A for effort with adjusting for covid concerns."
DawnP,"Dined on August 13, 2020",4,It was cool considering it's COVID 19
CrystalR,"Dined on August 12, 2020",4,The food was delicious but the seating was not good.  The outside seating is situated over the subway. We were sweating bullets.
MadisynM,"Dined on August 12, 2020",3,Food was great! The steak is amazing. I'd recommend.
MookiB,"Dined on August 10, 2020",3,"The food was pretty good. The appetizers were amazing though..definitely recommend the rock shrimp tempuraüî•üî•üî•. The porterhouse for 2 was okay. The table(seating 2) was too small and cramped for all the food we ordered. To me the restaurant is okay, hopefully my next experience would be better. The manager called immediately following my complaint to make things right, so i will definitely give an update on the second visit."
cmkt,"Dined on August 10, 2020",3,"Overall, the food was OK. If anything, the appetizers were truly the star of the evening for us: dumplings (french onions and philly cheesesteak) and rock shrimp tempura. Since it is a ""chop house"", we decided to order the 55 day dry aged porterhouse for two (medium rare), and it was a miss. The steak did not offer much flavor and was watered down... definitely disappointed. However, the restaurant and staff were very kind and took the proper precautions during this unprecedented time of COVID-19."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 9, 2020",5,AMAZING ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùóFrench onion soup dumplings & lamb chops are a must
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 9, 2020",5,It was a great atmosphere.
Kayy,"Dined on August 8, 2020",5,"I had an amazing first time at Brooklyn Chop House, social distancing style! I went to dinner in the evening and would recommend more lighting throughout the tent for guests. Otherwise, I can't wait to go back!"
BrianL,"Dined on August 8, 2020",5,"A restaurant putting in the extra work during these times deserves to make it. Strong coverings outside protected from the rain while carefully prepared individually wrapped plate, water glass, and cutlery were packaged for guest protection. Temperature taking metal detectors?! Before a guest can enter the building to use the restroom - very cool addition. They let us pay a corkage for some Krug a friend brought, in addition to the 8+ Dirty martinis we put back. Not cheap, but if you want to support a hard working group - make a night out of it here."
Blane,"Dined on August 7, 2020",4,The servers were attentive and thorough. My party was seated in a timely manor Upon arrival.  The food was extremely salty and the short rib was over cooked.  The cocktails were good!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 6, 2020",5,Love this place. The food is amazing and so is the service. This will be a regular spot
Britt,"Dined on August 6, 2020",5,"Everything was good....no complaints, I‚Äôd definitely come back"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 5, 2020",5,Was a great dinner despite it being a pandemic. I can only imagine if it wasn‚Äôt. Had a superb time
Shady,"Dined on August 5, 2020",4,Food was amazing! Can't wait to go back. Dumplings and chocolate cheesecake
Andre,"Dined on August 4, 2020",5,Our server was very knowledgeable and took care of us very well.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 3, 2020",4,"The Surf and Turf especially the lobster needed more salt and pepper, otherwise was a good meal the cocktails was delicious"
Racquel,"Dined on August 3, 2020",5,Birthday Dinner for my mom
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 3, 2020",4,"The food was great, however I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it how I wanted to because of the heat."
GuerlineM,"Dined on August 3, 2020",4,Place is okay but a bit pricey for the quality and amount of feed.
Tiara,"Dined on August 2, 2020",4,The Steak and Salt & Pepper lobster were delicious. My bf ordered the lamb chops and he wasn‚Äôt really a huge fan of them. We also ordered shrimp fried rice and that was BOMB. We are definitely returning.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 2, 2020",2,"The food overall was ok. The Short Rib Bao Buns and the dumplings we started with where pretty good. The problem was with the steaks we ordered, the quality of the meat was poor. We also ordered the lobster fried rice and it was bad as well. I wouldn‚Äôt go back. BUT our server was amazing! He was super nice and did great."
KurtH,"Dined on August 2, 2020",5,Anniversary
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 1, 2020",5,Loved it great job
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 1, 2020",5,"Chose Brooklyn Chop to celebrate a friends birthday dinner. Arrived 4pm and was the first ones at the restaurant (didn‚Äôt mind at all) . Temperature checks were required in order to enter restaurant due to the COVID guidelines. Also dined outdoors which also followed the guidelines. Each table was set with dishwater wrapped in individual plastic. Staff were fast, knowledgeable and friendly. Outdoor dining was comfortable. Food was Definitely worth every penny and the portion sizes were very filling. We arrived so hungry and had so much to take home after ordering drinks , appetizers and entrees. Definitely a great choice and will be returning."
KylaR,"Dined on July 31, 2020",4,It‚Äôs a cute place for a date the soft shell fried fries was amazing.
Tann,"Dined on July 31, 2020",4,Wasn‚Äôt a bad experience. They did pretty well being that outdoor dining‚Äôs the only option at this time. But to make it a smooth experience they should really work with reservations and proper management of timing.
Libi,"Dined on July 30, 2020",5,"Our waiter was awesome! From the moment we walked up to where the restaurant location, we were welcomed and seated within minutes of our reservation. The food choices we great and my waiter Steven made some wonderful choices for me that I thoroughly enjoyed. We‚Äôll be back next week for sure for our girls night."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 30, 2020",4,I visited this past wednesday for a dinner date to celebrate my birthday. Our server was great and very attentive and the food was great. I just felt like the outdoor dining area was extemely tight and couldve used a fan or two because it was very hot.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 30, 2020",5,I had a wonderful time celebrating my birthday. My waiter Rodney was very nice! Will definitely come back.
KathrynS,"Dined on July 30, 2020",1,It was extremely hot we were sitting on top of a pothole that blows steam up so every 5-10 minutes a burst of hot air would instantly come .. which caused the overall experience to be poor.
MashonP,"Dined on July 30, 2020",2,Good was tasteless and over priced  server was pleasant scene was nice
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 29, 2020",3,"1st Waiter had a bad attitude and was very dismissive. Didn‚Äôt even introduce himself . When I was telling him I had a dairy allergy he had an attitude. I asked to speak to the manager and get a different server. The manager refused to come and instead just sent a different server. If it weren‚Äôt for Covid-19 and the fact that we had a 9:15pm RSVP and wasn‚Äôt seated until 10:42 I would have walked right out. My steak was extremely over cooked and past well done . I asked for medium well because I am pregnant and the meat has to be cooked through. I didn‚Äôt want to be eating dry tough steak. The second server made the night more enjoyable however, I won‚Äôt be going back to This establishment."
Foodie101,"Dined on July 29, 2020",5,Wonderful service!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 29, 2020",5,Awesome black owned restaurant
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 28, 2020",3,The fact that they built the seating area on top of the train sewer is beyond me
June,"Dined on July 28, 2020",4,"We spent $200 for 5 items. The food wasn‚Äôt bad. I really enjoyed the glazed ribs and the lychee frose and martini was the best. But for those prices we should have had more food, at least an entree. I‚Äôd probably go back But for drinks only."
Courtney,"Dined on July 27, 2020",5,"Food was amazing, table was ready right away and service was efficient"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 27, 2020",5,We enjoyed it. The food was AMAZING!! Will be back again
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 26, 2020",5,"I love Brooklyn Chophouse, everything was amazing, staff was really accommodating. Best restaurant üòã"
AyishaF,"Dined on July 26, 2020",3,"Dining out in a COVID 19 world can be an experience. Eating on the side of the street with weird smells and people  walking by can be quite the task. Brooklyn Chop House tries to recreate the ambience outside as they have inside but the elements seem to win here! Hoping to get back inside soon! Food is always great, waiter staff could have been more attentive and friendly."
tony75,"Dined on July 26, 2020",5,Service was great. The food was amazing I would definitely go back and soon.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 25, 2020",5,"Brooklyn Chop House Has The BEST Customer Service & Experience Ever, They‚Äôre All So Hospitable & Welcoming. My Waiter Jaquan Was Perfect & Fast !"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 25, 2020",5,Wait was pretty long due to COVID 19
YanaB,"Dined on July 25, 2020",3,The waiter wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask  There was no social distancing  It was crowded under the tent
ElleNYC,"Dined on July 25, 2020",4,"Food was delicious, the crowd was very loud, service was good. It may be in good taste to not ask a patron when you hand them a bill with one credit card, if its just one card. Not every person of color splits bills."
SMART,"Dined on July 24, 2020",1,The food isn't great here. the dishes are way too salty. The caesar salad with bacon was a complete disaster. The drinks were way too sweet. The guy at the front door was kind of a nut. I will never comeback here ever again.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 24, 2020",5,"A+++++, as always the food was awesome and the service was exceptional."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 23, 2020",5,Great making another reservation tonight
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 23, 2020",2,It was raining and it took the employees a long time to open the plastic covering. When they finally did open them their was so much water that spilled all over me and my chair. I never got a sorry from no one and I was kind of disappointed because this is one of my favorite restaurants.
Randy,"Dined on July 22, 2020",2,"The food was subpar in relation to the price. The dumpling appetizers were under cooked. For the main course, we ordered the snapper which NEEDED the sauce that it came with. A side sauce should compliment a dish, not be a requirement in order to make the dish edible. We had a server named Alex who was exceptional!!! He was very kind and professional and is the only reason why this restaurant received a decent rating. The restaurant is over-hyped."
RichardD,"Dined on July 22, 2020",5,"Brooklyn Chop House keeps getting better.  They now have tables set up across Spruce Street from the restaurant, as well as all along the restaurant on their side of the street, and structures with covers set up in former street parking places.  All told, they may have more seating now than pre-pandemic.  They‚Äôve been offering their full menu for a few weeks now, which includes their famous dumplings with unusual fillings."
JohannaD,"Dined on July 21, 2020",5,Amazing experience!  Would definitely dine here again!
Nicole,"Dined on July 21, 2020",5,Jaiquan is the best server!! He‚Äôs attentive and makes great suggestions!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 21, 2020",4,Great service and beautiful ambiance. The food was ok.
WaverlyG,"Dined on July 20, 2020",4,"Initially, we were skeptical about outdoor dining during the pandemic.  However, upon arrival the atmosphere was welcoming.  The waiter (Steve) was accommodating and the food and drinks were prepared deliciously.  Our appetizers consisted of Reuben dumplings and chicken satays. My wife ordered the lobster salad, my son and I shared the porterhouse steak for two. The side dishes of pork fried rice and broccoli with garlic were added.  The cost was pricey but well worth it!  Definitely a return visit is imminent."
DavidH,"Dined on July 19, 2020",3,Overpriced drinks and food...but very tasty...good environment
Jmills,"Dined on July 19, 2020",3,Food was good and staff was extremely accommodating.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 19, 2020",5,It was wonderful! The food was excellent!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 19, 2020",5,"The setup was great especially during this time of the worldwide pandemic that we‚Äôre facing. During this time outside dining is the go to  what more can you ask for. Oh & Remember to please wear your mask around others everyone , its the least we all can do during this time."
Jenee,"Dined on July 18, 2020",5,"Had a really nice date night. It was very nice despite COVID only allowing out door dining, the scenery was beautiful. The staff was very efficient and friendly. Definitely going back again."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 18, 2020",4,This is a great spot to celebrate a birthday or anniversary. The food & drinks was amazing. Service was fast and speedy. I would definitely come back.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 17, 2020",5,I love this place
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 17, 2020",5,Great experience. Only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the mashed potato Other then that the food was Delicious
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 17, 2020",1,Disappointed waited around while having a reservation and never got sat.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 17, 2020",3,Honestly not a person that ever writes negative reviews. I was so excited to go there. Heard so many good things. Server to start didn‚Äôt take our drink orders for a solid 20 minutes or even come up to us and then it probably took another 25/30 minutes to get our drink order. We asked multiple food runners to get our server for us. We ordered a martini and it was served in a whiskey glass but that doesn‚Äôt really matter to us. Food was nothing special. Maybe we didn‚Äôt order right things. But was extremely disappointed with all the hype around the Brooklyn chop house.
Chrissy,"Dined on July 16, 2020",5,"Most delicious dinner, everything was cooked to perfection. Felt very safe considering covid, all dinnerware was wrapped in plastic and seats, table, and divider were all sanitized between guests. Was a little loud since another table was celebrating a birthday but overall great night"
JoyS,"Dined on July 16, 2020",1,"The service was awful. There‚Äôs no point in a reservation if the hostess is going to make you wait/seat others who came after you, before you. My server checked on our table ONE time. I understand restaurants are more busy than usual but two hours to wait for food is unacceptable. When I raised my concerns to the ‚Äúowner‚Äù he tried to compensate for the poor service with just a frozen drink. I will never return there again."
RichardD,"Dined on July 16, 2020",5,"Brooklyn Chop House has improved its outdoor seating since the first time we ate there in its new configuration (it was already pretty good the first time).  The outdoor seating is now entirely covered, and there are lots of plexiglass partitions between tables.  Having Brooklyn Chop House available in the Fulton/Civic Center neighborhood is especially important these days with many other nearby favorites (Beekman Pub, Augustine, Temple Court, Pier 17 restaurants, Paris Cafe, etc. not having re-opened."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 16, 2020",5,Had a great experience with it being my first time eating out since the pandemic. Going back this week!!
JuanG,"Dined on July 15, 2020",2,I‚Äôm sorry to write this review because when it comes down to presentation the restaurant went above and beyond in preparation for covid but the Food didn‚Äôt have that wow effect. I can live with that but the vents underneath because of passing trains made me and my girlfriend feel as if we were eating in a sauna. The smell in the area was pungent and across the street with the camps just made the experience horrible. Why horrible because it was an anniversary and I felt bad for my girlfriend. Service was fair but I would have drank a lot more to distract me if the waiter showed up a bit more and I didn‚Äôt like that I had to look for him to get my bill. Honestly I could have walked out and no one noticed but that‚Äôs not me. I‚Äôm sure many people have. For right now. Pass and wait till the area cleans up.
RoyB,"Dined on July 14, 2020",1,Pretty bad ambiance and experience as they sat you next to garbage there were water bugs and rodents. The water bugs came flying around your food. I dunno I know it‚Äôs Covid19 and this is an effort by all. They were just so lackadaisical About it all as if you say ‚Äútake it or leave it‚Äù
danield,"Dined on July 13, 2020",5,The food was perfect. The service was accommodating.
ErinM,"Dined on July 10, 2020",4,I was really upset that I didn‚Äôt get to order the chicken Satay‚Äôs. We would have had to wait an hour for them and I wasn‚Äôt doing that. Service was a little slow but it was totally understandable. They were running from inside to outdoors. Servers were very nice. And the food was delicious.
CatherineD,"Dined on July 9, 2020",4,Wasn‚Äôt expecting to be outdoors. But it was nice none the less
tvPatrick,"Dined on July 9, 2020",4,Always a plea

tbnycgirl,"Dined on July 5, 2020",5,Was one of the best nights out we have had since before the world changed- TY for being ahead of the curve and building the plastic protectors for the outdoor seating and as always your staff is what makes it so much fun- pandemic or not we were feeling pretty lucky to have scored a great spot. Always a treat and TY for getting it!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 4, 2020",5,Jay was my waiter he was the best waitress ever. Great service and great food
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 4, 2020",5,Due to Covid it was outside no so appealing  The food was delicious outstanding
RichardD,"Dined on July 4, 2020",5,"Brooklyn Chop House just recently opened their outdoor dining on Spruce Street, taking a few former parking spaces.  It‚Äôs very well conceived and partially covered.  The menu is more limited than it was pre-pandemic, but they still have some of the best dumplings around, with non-traditional fillings."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 3, 2020",5,"Had the pleasure of dining @ Brooklyn Chop House last night. Daniel our waiter was exceptional and very attentive.  Now the food, We started off with Spicy Shrimp, Bacon Satays & the Lettuce wraps & I can honestly say all starters were made to perfection with generous amounts of food to be starters. Main course consisted of The NY Prime & Vegetable Fried Rice , Best steak I‚Äôve had the pleasure of eating in a very long time along with the fried rice.. Perfect!! This establishment has also went above & beyond addressing any concerns you may have eating during these turbulent times.. Great Job Brooklyn ChHouse!!!"
kathleenb,"Dined on March 15, 2020",5,Great atmosphere food was great definitely will go back again environment calm and quiet
ThomasC,"Dined on March 15, 2020",5,"Literally everything we ordered was outstanding, good service, great drinks. We got 5 different dumplings, and the LSD, which was a combo of lobster, steak, Duck(we changed to chicken), onion rings and two types of fried rice to be shared by the table.  The owner even came to our table to tel us about the restaurant and what to order. Nice friendly staff, will definitely be going back there"
luv2eat,"Dined on March 15, 2020",5,"From the start, service was top notch! Every dish was fabulous"
shepo,"Dined on March 13, 2020",2,"The service was subpar. Even the manager, who we had to call over more than once couldn‚Äôt get it right. He offered to buy us a round of drinks, which was nice, but he got that wrong as well. Brooklyn Cop House is an ala carte steakhouse, with a flair, but has the smallest tables so it was hard to set all the plates on it. Some other observations: the veal chop comes sliced but that isn‚Äôt mentioned on the menu.  It seems as though the restaurant wants to be a family style place where everyone tastes each other‚Äôs meals. Again that is not advertised. One surprising mention: the staff put steak knives at everyone in the party‚Äôs setting. When they realized only one of us ordered steak they picked up the others and put them back in the serving tray not knowing if anyone had used them or not. Overall, not worth the money and definitely not worth the rating they get."
Nyse1105,"Dined on March 12, 2020",4,The appetizers were delicious and there wasn‚Äôt a bad one in our order.  The main courses were just ok.  I‚Äôve eaten here before and the main course were fantastic so maybe it was just an off night
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 9, 2020",4,Everything was wonderful besides the size of the establishment everything was awesome i also got to meet the owner and his partner
Love2Eat,"Dined on March 9, 2020",1,Service was the worse- slow and unprofessional. Steak arrived cold and it took 10 minutes for the waitress to check on us while we were trying to call her. She offered to reheat the steak! Why should we eat a reheated steak that your served cold from first place. So we walk out eating only small appetizer with a barely apologies from the place.
SarabelS,"Dined on March 9, 2020",4,"Overall all was good however, we waited too long for drinks. Food was great. Ambiance was also great."
Mogotluv,"Dined on March 8, 2020",5,"I had been wanting to try the food at Brooklyn Chop House for a while now. I live in Virginia but come to NYC quite often but never make it to Brooklyn Bridge. I have to say the food, the service and the hold vibe was even better than I expected. I was able to meet the manager Stratis Morfogen who was so pleasant and working as hard as his staff to make sure everything was running smoothly. I will definitely be back ‚ù§Ô∏è"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 8, 2020",5,Great food great service
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 8, 2020",5,Loved it!!!
RajM,"Dined on March 8, 2020",2,"We asked the waiter to describe crispy beef and he said it‚Äôs slices of beef deep fried. When we got it, it was beef coated with lots of flour deep fried and soaked in sweet sauce. We tried it but couldn‚Äôt eat it and told them that we did not like the dish but still had to pay $30 for that dish. They did not take it off the bill.  We also asked the waiter to describe Mayo prawns. The waiter described ‚Äúsaut√©ed prawns in honey‚Äù.    Waste of money. Never going back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 7, 2020",5,"Loved it! Ambiance, vibe, food! I will be going back."
BriaNicole,"Dined on March 6, 2020",1,The food takes hours to come out. It makes you want to leave and never return to the restaurant again to eat. Seating is fine. Music was cool. Waiter tried his hardest. The manager did help with the bill somewhat but it was very disappointing to wait hours for your food to come out. It‚Äôs really bad and keeps getting worst ever time I go.
JosephineB,"Dined on March 6, 2020",5,Best choice of restaurant to celebrate my birthday. I already recommended this restaurant to my co workers

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 1, 2020",5,Meal was aaaaamazing.  Some of the best Peking duck and ribeye I‚Äôve ever had.  And the cheeseburger dumplings are a must!
Megs,"Dined on February 28, 2020",3,"The high notes of the meal were the sides and an appetizer, recommend the eggplant, mushrooms, chicken noodles and fries. The porterhouse for two was tender, cooked as asked and presented beautifully. Would have been flawless if it had a char crust and a bit more salt. All that said, not planning to return as the service was lackluster and detracted from the experience."
MathewL,"Dined on February 26, 2020",5,"We were in from out of town. Found the place in yelp. Excellent food. Excellent service. The owner was randomly checking in on tables. When he got to us he apologized for being in a hoodie, but it was his day off and he was just checking in. Nice guy. Clearly cares very much about delivering an excellent service and product."
UlishB,"Dined on February 25, 2020",5,Food quality is superb.  Everything was excellent. Definitely a place to dine at.
MSCS817,"Dined on February 25, 2020",1,Absolutely horrible in every sense of the word. Steak was cold and all fat. Service was terrible and worst of all MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION WAS STOLEN AFTER I ATE THERE and several fraudulent charges appeared the following day. Worst restaurant ever.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 24, 2020",5,"It‚Äôs was my partners birthday and our sever made our evening, everyone was super polite and welcoming. We will definitely be back."
DylanG,"Dined on February 23, 2020",4,"I went to the Brooklyn chop House Saturday night with three friends for a going away party. We had a 9:45 reservations but we weren‚Äôt seated until about 11:30 the hostesses at the front had no information about anything going on but offered us free champagne. We were very frustrated waiting to get our table, but once we were seated we forgot about the horror we went through trying to get the table. Our waiter was amazing and the food came out so quick. We tried about 10 dishes and every dish was above our expectations! Will definitely come back again and hopefully the front of the house will be more organized!"
SoVeryTracey,"Dined on February 23, 2020",5,"BEFORE Covid-19 this spot was hip, hot, and lively.  I'm not from NYC, but I would return here in a heartbeat once I start travelling again.  Delicious food, fun atmosphere, and lots of great, sexy energy, while still being proper for a family gathering.  Can't wait to go back!"
DeniseM,"Dined on February 23, 2020",5,"Although the wait was a bit long, it was worth it. My husband and I can‚Äôt wait to visit again."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 19, 2020",5,We celebrated my daughter's 18th birthday here. The food was great; the service was great; most of all my daughter loved loved loved the wonderful pictures she was able to take in the bathroom area!!!

RayLopez55,"Dined on February 17, 2020",1,"The couple next to us was having an argument for about 30 minutes very loudly which made our dinner uncomfortable. The steak was good the side orders were steak fries, fried rice, hardly any vegetables or mashed potatoes."
Jennyrider,"Dined on February 17, 2020",5,"We had at reservation on Valentine's  day weekend  ,we were seated right away food was good ,but be prepared  to spend $$ date night was 180$ including tip. Overall  a good time was had."
JessicaG,"Dined on February 16, 2020",3,"They had a pre-fix menu for Valentines Day, which was ok.. The appetizers were dumplings (horrible)... My entree of choice was steak. The steak was warm, you can tell it was Pre-cooked hours before. It wasn't one of the best steaks I‚Äôve had, especially for the price we paid; the meal could have been better."
Lilcherry2,"Dined on February 16, 2020",4,"The food was good but I expected better. I guess since it was Valentine‚Äôs Day and they had a pre-fix menu. We got there a little earlier than our reservations and had to wait an extra 10 min after our scheduled time. The place was pack but the seating arrangements could of been more intimate for couples. Some tables were literally right next to other couples u can hear their entire convo. Overall it was a good experience, will be back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 16, 2020",1,I made reservations about a month in advance to dine here on Saturday the 15th
ChelseaB,"Dined on February 15, 2020",5,"It was great. They have a good selection of hip-hop music, which I loved. It‚Äôs well-decorated and has dim lighting, so very romantic for date night. Came here on Valentine‚Äôs Day and loved it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 15, 2020",4,"I went on Valentine‚Äôs Day and although it felt like forever in heels, the wait wasn‚Äôt that bad. There are two parking garages available so that wasn‚Äôt a problem. We had the steak and the salt and pepper fried lobster...everything was delicious and the froze roll drink was great as well. Every couple got a red velvet cake for desert and the women got a long stem rose at the end of the nice. Overall the experience was great. I‚Äôd definitely go back."
TalurP,"Dined on February 15, 2020",3,There was no heat on the entire time I was there. I was seated next to the door and it was freezing

GeorgeA,"Dined on February 15, 2020",2,My issue was opentable nor chop house said it was a 175.00 fixed valentine menu only when I did the reservation.  Not happy.
SusanP,"Dined on February 15, 2020",3,Made a reservation for Valentine‚Äôs Day and apparently they decided to turn that into a prix fixe menu. $175 for two people and they did not mention that when you made the reservations. So we had Perused the menu and picked out all the things that we wanted to order but were stuck getting what they wanted us to eat instead of what we wanted to eat. We got there at 4 PM and it wasn‚Äôt even half full.  they offered to let us buy extra food from Menu if we wanted to get a steak but Not only steak. servers were nice but distracted.  The food ended up costing more prix fixe then it would have if we just order it off the menu. That place is jam packed with so many little tables that aren‚Äôt even big enough to hold the food.  Literally every inch of the table Realestate was covered up and plates were hanging off the edges. There‚Äôs no way the waiters can efficiently move around because there was no space to squeeze in between people and they were constantly having to bump into peoples chairs to get by. I‚Äôve literally never seen anything like it. upstairs had a speaker cranking out very loud music. The food was just OK. The salt and pepper lobster Supposedly 2 pounds was mostly shell they literally cut up the lobster with the shell on it and deep-fried it. Except there was only two pieces of tail in there which means they took out the good parts and deep-fried everything else. No seasoning. It was so terrible. What a waste of $400 for TWO people. I will never be back.  Im so disappointed-based on the reviews I thought It was going to be fantastic.  We ordered a ribeye for an extra $70 because that‚Äôs what we wanted originally.  It was cooked perfectly but there was literally zero seasoning on it and they don‚Äôt even have salt and pepper on tables. plain meat flavor. Yuck.  Restaurants like this get so greedy during the holidays and don‚Äôt think of the customers.   That place was a literal fire hazard of jam packed tables. Horrible experience all around.
JAMESE,"Dined on February 15, 2020",5,Food is amazing
dianaH,"Dined on February 14, 2020",2,No waiter showed up. Eventually got assigned one after 20 minutes. Dumplings were good. Surf and turf was very disappointing. Meat wasn‚Äôt flavored and the sauce was on/under both items. Having your surf and turf taste similarly is just wrong. Tried to end on a positive note with a sweet treat but the hot fudge sundae was made with cold fudge. #pointless
JaniceF,"Dined on February 14, 2020",3,"Its a high priced asian food! Same taste as the corner store asian food though. Drinks were ok. Music was loud and songs were vulgar. Should get a DJ, sound like it was playing on a home stereo."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 12, 2020",4,"I was so excited to be visiting NYC for my boyfriends birthday  in fact I was a bit confused by how terrible our service was. Once seated we were not greeted for AT LEAST 10-15 minutes. Given it was busy I let it go and was patient, however even once the service did begin the service I noticed right away our server seemed not-so-thrilled. We started with the Satay, and lamb dumplings. We also got two cocktails ; the ‚Äúblackberry smash‚Äù, and the other one was called ‚ÄúThis Side of the Bridge‚Äù.  Drinks were absolutely amazing but server Did not feature or highlight any of them. Not only did he not go into depth about any of the menu items, but he also hardly came over for quality checks/table manicuring. HUGE No-No when you have guests that are spending big & traveling FAR. Server was very judgmental & negligent. Maybe too tired from fashion week?   I am writing this review not because I didn‚Äôt enjoy the food, drinks, or ambiance, but because I HATED everything about our service. To top that off it was very clear who the GM/Owner was. He was dressed very nicely and seemed to be checking in on tables however I noticed he ONLY interacted with 1 table the entire time we sat! I probably starred this guy down atleast 5 times desperately trying to give him the cue to stop by our table and ask how it was going. Instead he would glance back without ever coming over, or just outright not even look back. I felt very annoyed knowing I traveled to specifically eat at HIS restaurant and not even one time were we approached by the GM/Owner. I really expected more and I would have loved to leave 22% as the food  but that service (not so much)."
GregoryK,"Dined on February 9, 2020",3,"service wasn't great, ambience was decent, quality of food was decent but the menu was way overpriced. Dessert was also uninspiring."

ChrisD,"Dined on February 6, 2020",5,"One of my favorite new restaurants that I will add to my short list. I enjoyed my visit very much so and my server was amazing to say the least. Chef the short ribs were amazing and with the noodles it was a home run! Bartender made my spicy margaritas just how I like them and the rest is history. Special thanks to the BOH team, busboys & hostess.  Last but not least thank you Stratis and thank you for your great hospitality. Best, Chef Dreams P.S wait the Short rib buns wth, super super must eat when I visit again:)"
Shelly,"Dined on February 6, 2020",5,This is my 3rd time at the restaurant and my experience is always the same. The food is amazing. The service not so much. The servers are always friendly but they need to work on timing. For example every time we go we have to find our waiter. This time we waited 45 minutes before someone came to take our order. But this will not deter me. I will keep going because the food is worth it.

Definitely on the keeper list, preferably with more people lol"

BkCassie,"Dined on January 2, 2020",5,"I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED MY DINNER HERE! But make sure that you set your GPS to lower Manhattan because there is nothing going on at 150 Nassau Street in Brooklyn. After 7 PM would be the ideal time to go because you should be able to easily snag a parking spot in front of the restaurant.  The dining experience was 5-star because everything was full of flavor. I would caution that the appetizers are not enough for sharing but definitely order one of their unique Asian fusion options per person. The shining star was our 32 oz Prime steak which was cooked to the perfect temperature, wonderfully seasoned and accompanied by a generous amount of ‚Äúau jus"" sauce. We also shared an order of crab fried rice which was delicious.   The awesome food was complimented by the stellar service provided by Jay. Being a fellow Capricorn, he made sure to pay us enough attention, kept the birthday boy's glass full at all time and even brought up a slice of red velvet cake at the right time. He set the bar so high that I wouldn't chance sitting in anyone else's section upon my next visit.  Looking for a great steak but needing more variety than your usual boring steakhouse sides then this is exactly where you need to dine!"
ABrad713,"Dined on January 2, 2020",5,"The food was amazing! The ambiance was perfect! And I couldn't say enough about our waiter Tony. Extremely attentive, gave us space so we didn‚Äôt feel pestered. He was able to answer all of our questions since it was our first time here. There wasn‚Äôt a long wait for our food. We spent 3 hours here and didn‚Äôt feel rushed one bit. And might I add the Philly cheesesteak dumplings are the BOMB! We definitely plan to come back. And they have organic choices!!!! Enough said!"

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 1, 2020",5,Great service great food just a tight areas for seating didnt have much elbow room at my table
1ladyj,"Dined on December 30, 2019",2,"Really disappointed with the experience and service. Loud setting, sat by two large party. Table was not cleaned (wet and I actually sat on a damp tray left on the seat). I was loving forward to a romantic but was quite unnerved by the nonchalant attitude of the seater and waiter throughout the meal. I will not be returning or recommending to others. Perhaps this is a better place for birthday parties."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 25, 2019",5,"Brooklyn Chophouse was a very nice out. the ambiance was pleasant, food was good tasting and reasonably priced. The service was great.

LatoyaB,"Dined on December 16, 2019",5,"I loved it. Great ambiance, hospitality. And music selection. Would definitely come again."
KaeM,"Dined on December 15, 2019",1,"There wasn‚Äôt a chance to have an experience. The visit turned into a 1.5 hour wait even with a reservation (that was made 2 weeks in advance). Decided to visit this place from Dallas with my friend (who happens to be a food critic). We were finally seated- asked for order, then to be told 20 mins later that there is not food. Waiter informed that Chef and staff has walked out. Here‚Äôs the icing on the cake, waiter noted that Manager would be over to discuss  and assumingely apologize. We waited an add‚Äôl 15 mins to be told by waiter that the Manager is busy and won‚Äôt be coming and basically we should just leave and they will take care of the cocktails we ordered. This is unacceptable! Never thought this would be how we end the night at 1:30am looking for food that we thought we made a reservation for.  Brooklyn Chop House should Chop it up! This type of service and experience will not sustain a business!"
Rock,"Dined on December 15, 2019",5,It was amazing!!! Service was excellent and so was the food. Will be returning soon.
troyez,"Dined on December 15, 2019",2,food was ok but not good. the atmosphere was good. the food was a little overpriced.
RachelW,"Dined on December 14, 2019",1,The food was fine. Waitstaff messes up our order and the two tables next to us orders as well. The music was far too loud. Went for graduation dinner and majorly wish we went elsewhere.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 14, 2019",5,"Our first time at BCH and it did not disappoint!! We have gone to NYC every year for Christmas and always have a big family dinner somewhere special.

Adnama10,"Dined on December 8, 2019",1,"We didn‚Äôt even stay for water.  Walked in and no one manning the reception podium.  Once the hostess arrived, we were seated at a table.  The water glasses were filthy - still had lipstick marks around the top.  No one came to our table for 10 minutes, even for water so we left."
Shannonj,"Dined on December 7, 2019",4,Brooklyn Chop house is very trendy but nice. A little crowded but that is to be expected from a hot spot. The music and ambiance were excellent while still serving great food.i can understand why some would say it was pricey but not any more than a top steak house would cost. The dumplings are well worth the visit alone.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 7, 2019",3,"Overcrowded because of a holiday party, steaks were raw, had to get a hot plate to heat up the steak, drinks served warm everytime. Just not a good place for the price. Dim sun was good but pricey"
AndrewT,"Dined on December 4, 2019",2,Went there for lunch. The food has gone downhill. Ordered the steak sandwich which we were told was sliced filet Mignon. My friend sent his back bc it was sliced bits off the end of the steak which contains fat and grizzle. Waiter disappeared for all of the meal and no manager to be found. Sad to see because when they first opened it was better run. Other places nearby to spend my money at.
Aaliyah,"Dined on December 2, 2019",5,"The food was excellent, I do plan to go here again sometime this month, I loved it ."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 24, 2019",2,Took almost an hour to get our steaks. We finished our appetizers and then waited 25 minutes before our steaks came. By then we really didn‚Äôt have an appetite to eat steak anymore. Eating is not a start/stop exercise.

LaurenE,"Dined on November 23, 2019",4,"Great food, fun ambiance, great waiter service - but very confusing host service.  has happened on a few occasions (reservations not being honored, not very welcome when entering, etc.)  still think the place is worth going to for the food and fun vibe, and since the actual waitstaff seems very nice the chunk of the evening should be great here - but just be prepared for the start of it to be a little off compared to other similar restaurants who don't seem to have that problem."
Mikes,"Dined on November 23, 2019",4,Food was excellent. Drinks were excellent. Service was excellent. I have no complaints.

TiffanyJ,"Dined on November 17, 2019",5,We went to Brooklyn Chop House for their dim sum brunch which was great. Our server Jay was so nice and welcoming. He was really great at suggesting drink and food items from their menu. The dim sum was really good but I did not care for the cheeseburger dumpling but the  pastrami dumpling was great!

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 7, 2019",2,"Very odd, greasy and flavorless square burger with three flat patties.  The bun was shaped like a triangle and it was too small. Reminded me of a Wendy‚Äôs burger but there‚Äôs is better.   The greens in the side salad were quite limp.  Not sure I‚Äôll be back."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 3, 2019",5,First time here for my birthday. And it was beyond what I expected! Everything was so good. They tried to sit us by the door where it was cold. After saying something twice the Hostos finally moved us. The perfect margarita was perfect! And the red velvet cake was to die for!
Natasha,"Dined on November 3, 2019",5,"The management at this Resturant was very accommodating, I had a party of 8 that turned into a party of 6, then went up to 9 and they accommodated my party. The food was great, they serve big servings where two people can eat together, not separately. I would recommend this Resturant."
StaceyM,"Dined on November 3, 2019",5,"Our experience was great. From the location, ambiance, music, bartenders, drinks, wait staff, crowd and last but definitely not least.....the food. Amazing!! A little wait time even with reservations but worth it."

AllisonH,"Dined on October 30, 2019",5,Decided that our last evening meal in nyc should be memorable. It was fantastic!! Cocktails to start were poured to our liking. The wedge salad and filet mignon were perfectly prepared! The sorbet was a refreshing finish.  Wonderful service for a perfect experience!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 27, 2019",4,"I‚Äôve had better experiences there, but this was a Saturday night. Although we had reservations we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated, not horrible. Once we were seated it took another 20 minutes just for water. I was served dinner with no napkins, my drink was incorrect, and when the food came we were missing something and ordered 4 things to begin with. The food was still great but the service wasn‚Äôt as great!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 27, 2019",5,A lot of darkness
ShakaraC,"Dined on October 27, 2019",2,"I was really excited to go to this restaurant! The ambiance was very nice, our waiter was great, but I did not care too much for the food that we ordered. We had the filet and lobster for two (I was not aware that it would come crispy. The steak was battered and fried) and the steak was a bit over cooked. The batter was a bit mealy and kind of gummy. To be honest, we thought it was just gross. One of the people with us ordered the ribeye and that was just okay as it was a bit overcooked as well and the flavor wasn't too great. The fried rice was good and I enjoyed the wine. I wouldn't go back or recommend."
IkeD,"Dined on October 26, 2019",5,My second visit to the restaurant and it was just as good as the first!  Thanks for a great evening!

Phoenix,"Dined on October 21, 2019",5,"Came here for my mom's 55th birthday.  What I love about places like this is the ability to order a lot of food for the table and be able to eat communally.  We ordered the  Alaskan king crab legs, sweet and sour chicken,  braised short ribs, broccoli, and shrimp fried rice.  Everything was great, but the short ribs really took the cake.  I'm used to short ribs slathered in a sauce, usually barbecue.  I didn't miss that here at ALL.  I can tell that the flavor was intentionally built as every bite was amazing. Broccoli may seem basic, but it was anything but that at BCH; perfectly steamed, and seemed to be seasoned from within.  My mom and dad are some of the pickiest eaters-- it's often hard to get them to step out of their comfort zone, and they don't hesitate to let me know when they don't like something! BCH got rave reviews from them both, and I'm sure we all will be back. A special shout out to management for being accommodating of my mom's need to use accessibility options as she is in a scooter; everything was done with a smile and I'm so grateful for that."
DenaeJ,"Dined on October 20, 2019",5,"Had reservations arrived about 15min early, was seated right away . Waiter Emelio gave us menu asked if we have any questions explained things on the menu, took drink orders ...then we ordered the duck first ( takes 45 min to cook) while we still looking over menu .order appetizer crispy chicken wontons . Bottle of sweet white wine very tasty being I don‚Äôt drink but it was so good I had 3 glasses. Surf & turf Lobster tails & filet mignon melted in your mouth like butter!! Beef & broccoli, crispy chicken rice for two every thing was delicious and the chocolate cake is do die for ...super moist cake ..all I need was a glass of milk ...very expensive place but it was worth every penny ...after all it was my 50th birthday..you only live once treat your self !!"

Carl,"Dined on October 5, 2019",3,The food was ok but very overpriced. The apple wonton desert was horrible and worth no more then $3.00. It got very ghetto in the restaurant when a group of 20 people came in and was allowed to roll up blunts and smoke weed inside of the restaurant and the manager allowed it. I won‚Äôt come back
MorganR,"Dined on October 5, 2019",5,I had an optometrist visit this establishment for a date and it was a wonderful experience
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 5, 2019",5,"This place was everything I hoped it would be. The menu is fantastic along with the chefs. The server we had, Jaiquan, was one of the best servers I‚Äôve ever had. He was personable and easy going(didn‚Äôt rush us to make a food choice), answered any questions, and just all around seemed like a nice person. Steak was cooked to perfection and the rest of our choices were amazing and in good portions, we did not leave hungry. The restaurant itself is pretty relaxed with chill but good music selections playing in the background. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to come here for anything from a quick drink and bite to eat at the bar, to an anniversary dinner, or a group of friends out for a good time. I will definitely be back."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 13, 2019",2,"Cool ambiance - really cozy with good music, and great cocktails. The food was simply not good, and really overpriced ($17 for two tacos).

NichelleJ,"Dined on September 8, 2019",1,"We reserved a table for 7. There wasn't enough space for everyone. We asked to be moved and we weren't, eventhough there were tables with more space. The waiter cleaned up our dishes eventhough I wasnt finished eating. When I asked what happened to my food, he took it off of the cart with all tge dirty dishes and gave it back to me, disgusting. Then he added his own gratuity of 20% on the check which I asked to be removed and it was. The menu clearly states that a gratuity of 15% will be added to parties of 8 or more. I won't be returning."

KennyleJ,"Dined on September 5, 2019",5,"Flew in from Detroit for my fiance's 50th birthday, and have to say that we were both impressed!  Everything was perfect from the ambiance, food and service.  We had the lamb and cheese burger dumplings, along with the shrimp for appetizers.  All 3 were very tasty!  For dinner we had the surf & turf along with the black bass.  The fish melted in my mouth and was seasoned just right.  The lobster tails had a flavor that makes you want to keep coming back for more.  Looking forward to a return trip to NY so we can enjoy another scrumptious meal at the Brooklyn Chop House!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on September 3, 2019",3,"The service was friendly and hospitable, however, the food was disappointing. The rock shrimp was not crispy. Our lettuce wraps weren‚Äôt very hot or memorable. They didn‚Äôt have any social spice or texture. The veggie dumplings now use beyond meat. I was not told this and for a good 5min thought I, a vegetarian, ate real meat. They said they just recently replaced the melange of veggies with this meat substitute. For the quality of food, the prices were high. It was a fine experience, but we probably won‚Äôt go back."

Sunshine,"Dined on August 24, 2019",4,"The restaurant was very accommodating as my party size changed several times throughout the day. But, when  the waiter failed to bring a dish out it our festive night."
BrooklynTJC,"Dined on August 24, 2019",3,Good food but the experience felt a bit cheap! Service seems rushed.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 24, 2019",3,I went to this restaurant to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. Dinner was mediocre and so was the whole experience. Service was good. The hostess was great.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 19, 2019",4,"I came here on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and was more than pleased. The ambiance was great and it quiet but not comfortable . Enjoyed the food , it makes you think outside the box and try something different. Will return again"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 16, 2019",5,My Husbands Birthday . We had such a lovely time and the food was AMAZING!!!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 15, 2019",5,"Omg this place is a MUST TRY MUST GO!!! The food was delicious ... my server was extremely attentive, polite, and informative. I can‚Äôt quite remember his name but he was tall, dark skin, handsome and had a bald head. For appetizers we had something called pac man, we had some lobster rolls and some other delightful appetizers. For dinner we had lobster fried rice and the chicken that the server recommended. I had a great time!!! And will be going back within the next week to try the porterhouse steak for 2."
KimberlyC,"Dined on August 15, 2019",5,"Good Food & Excellent Service ! The host seated us right away; and she used my name when I called based on my number.  The server was great- informative and attentive.  Food was okay- not bad but not to die for.  I wrote under my res. note that we are celebrating a birthday, and once I said we are ready to order dessert he returned with a slice of RV cake and Lychee sorbet- even I was surprise. however it could have went left if we didn't like the option they brought out.  Would recommend to a friend."
Sydnee,"Dined on August 12, 2019",5,"Loved this restaurant. Took my mom here for her birthday andI  was worried if she‚Äôd enjoy the food because she‚Äôs a great cook and hard to please. She thought the food was ‚ÄúAwesome!‚Äù Would definitely recommend, and I‚Äôll be back for dinner again soon!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 11, 2019",2,Didn‚Äôt like the food
yumyum,"Dined on August 8, 2019",3,Went with clients and very nice place and easy to have a conversaton.  Was not what I expected.  Seems everything is for sharing.  Figured the app/dumpling were for sharing.  But the entree came and seemed like another app.  Sevice was great.
Leighmck,"Dined on August 6, 2019",5,Amazing food and drinks! Definitely would recommend!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on August 4, 2019",1,SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. If we didn‚Äôt remind him about our drinks i don‚Äôt think we would have gotten to them. He catered to table filled with intoxicated loud men and women (caucasian i must add so i‚Äôm not suprised). tip was included in bill so he got his 40 dollar tip doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. GREAT FOOD HORRRRIBBBLLLLLLE SERVICE. The ladies at the front were very sweet.
DianneG,"Dined on August 4, 2019",4,Great food and excellent service!  The appetizers are to die for especially the chicken satay...
Mondaybrunch,"Dined on August 4, 2019",2,"Celebrated friends birthday dinner, friendly greeter.  I placed notes that it was a birthday and not to be seated between anyone if possible. The waitress seemed like she can care less which was too bad because we had high expectations. Her lack of confidence and presence really dampened our dining experience. When asked about certain dishes on how it‚Äôs prepared she was not helpful nor equipped to answer simple questions. She only returned once to se if we needed refills on drinks. Luckily the food outshined her performance it was tolerated.  I was disappointed no one acknowledged it was a birthday dinner, usually the miatre d or wait staff would come by with a small birthday gesture. Will not be returning anytime soon. There was no ambience, no music the runners were more attentive than the wait staff obvious everyone was on their agenda"
Ak10462,"Dined on August 3, 2019",4,Food and service was great.  Staff was very polite from the hostess to the waiters.  Food is pricey but it is what it is ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  I would frequent again and recommend.

IndiaR,"Dined on July 28, 2019",5,"Absolutely amazing!! This was my 1st visiting this restaurant & it was nothing short of amazing. The staff were super friendly & kind , and not to mention the food, excellent and It‚Äôs far from pricey."
SadeG,"Dined on July 27, 2019",2,Overall I had a poor experience. The server we had at first had a terrible attitude. Then when we asked to switch servers the manager told us it wasn‚Äôt possible. Then we were greeted by another server. It was a very uncomfortable experience. And the food was not what I was expecting for the price.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on July 26, 2019",5,My group of 26 had a completely awesome time. The staff was outstanding
CTNYC,"Dined on July 26, 2019",3,"All apps delicious, had duck tacos, rock shrimp tempura (very good), fried wontons (eh) and short rib bao.  Entrees were mediocre, we had kung po chicken (way too much sauce), sweet & sour chicken (again way too much sauce) and salt & pepper shrimp (sent it back very dry & hard to swallow) and roast pork fried rice.  All entrees could have been had 3 blocks away in chinatown for a 1/4 of the price & better tasting.  Apps were the best part.  Noisy & tables very close together."
JillP,"Dined on July 26, 2019",5,"Chinese Steak House, who would have thought it would be so good.   Known for their dumpling selection. The onion soup dumplings are to die for."
OutofTowner,"Dined on July 24, 2019",4,Very enjoyable dining experience.  The appetizers were excellent and unusual.  Waiter was very helpful in making selections.  A definite must try place.
BxBee,"Dined on July 23, 2019",5,"Several colleagues and I went to Brooklyn Chop House for a business lunch. We loved the food, the service and the atmosphere. It is now on our list of go-to lunch places."
Jana,"Dined on July 19, 2019",1,"Definitely skip this place in the city. Service was horrible, nobody checked in on us.   Our burgers were three fast food burgers smothered in saut√©ed onions that we didn‚Äôt ask for.  The whole experience took an hour and 45 minutes and was very difficult to get our check.  Might‚Äôve been the lowest tip I‚Äôve ever given I should‚Äôve considered zero.  Very sloppy restaurant with a hodgepodge Seating arrangement.  The food took forever, we left before we received our desserts."
OutofTowner,"Dined on July 19, 2019",5,Excellent meal.  Drinks were good also.  The waiter made wonderful suggestions for appetizers and main course. Will definitely be back.

Reuben,"Dined on July 9, 2019",5,The only thing I didn‚Äôt like was the chicken satay was not seasoned at all. If just had the peanut sauce on it. The sauce was great but the chicken had no seasoning at all
LeonieT,"Dined on July 9, 2019",5,Amazing place amazing service amazing ambience glad I got to Celebrate my one year anniversary there.

JanW,"Dined on June 27, 2019",3,"The ambiance is great, however it was a long wait before the food came out ."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 27, 2019",2,The steak had no flavor. Probably one of the worst I have ever eaten. Tasteless. For 125.00 they should be ashamed.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 26, 2019",5,"First review ever that‚Äôs I‚Äôve posted.  From the two incredibly helpful hostess, to our server and bus boys, we received nothing but exceptional service.  I was there with my kids who both thought the food was amazing.  I was skeptical as to whether or not my 12 year old son could finish his 16oz filet - crushed it within minutes."
Cattex4,"Dined on June 26, 2019",3,"We ordered beef and broccoli which was amazing, but the fish was just ok. Waiter forgot about our drinks so we didn't get them until well into the meal, and otherwise the service was just ok. Would likely not go again."
KerryannR,"Dined on June 25, 2019",5,I had a great time for my 40th Birthday. I‚Äôll be back soon.
TiffanyS,"Dined on June 23, 2019",4,"Waiter kept bring over drinks we did not order. We I received the bill, the drinks portion reflected all the drinks we did not order.  We had to wait for a revised bill"
Tiffany,"Dined on June 22, 2019",5,Food & service was excellent!!! Would most definitely visit again....
KashifG,"Dined on June 21, 2019",5,Great experience there from amazing tasting food ! to great service would go back  most definetely .
dennis,"Dined on June 20, 2019",5,Best experience of dining in ever definitely going back soon
Trapper,"Dined on June 18, 2019",5,My boyfriend and I was satisfied. The bill was shocking if you don‚Äôt pay attention the gratuity is already included. Overall good but I will suggest you look over menu before you go. The drinks are 20$ each that was quite a shock but we enjoyed it
UshmaJS,"Dined on June 17, 2019",4,"The dinner was delicious but unfortunately since it was a busy day (Father's Day), the service took forever. We had specifically made a reservation at 5:15pm so we could be done by 7ish, since we had 2 young children. We weren't served until after 7pm. It was disappointing that tables that were seated after us were served before us. Jay was a great server and provided us comp drinks and a dessert."
TJfoodjunkies,"Dined on June 17, 2019",2,"in my opinion,  maybe a bit overpriced for the kind of food.  Food us is ok, not outstanding."
LadyB,"Dined on June 17, 2019",3,Brooklyn Chop House was a great restaurant the food was excellent it took a little bit longer than expected but it was very good.  The only complaint that day was the air conditioner was not working properly and there was no changing table in the ladies room to change infants and toddlers.
Franki143,"Dined on June 17, 2019",5,"Food was so good. I took my family there for Father‚Äôs Day. The staff was helpful and courteous. The drinks were weak though, I got 2 margaritas and felt like I was drinking juice. Overall the ambiance, food, lighting, just everything was worth the money and experience."
TakashiP,"Dined on June 16, 2019",5,A bit pricey but the food is excellent. Has lunch around 1:30pm and I wasn't hungry until the next day.
DeniseH,"Dined on June 16, 2019",5,The food was great. My only issue is that we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated despite having a reservation.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 16, 2019",2,"My bill came up to nearly 200 dollars with barely decent food. Steak was not prepared at temp we asked for and flavor was okayyyyy at best. Rock shrimp was definitely very basic and tasted literally like Costco fried shrimp and they dashed some supermarket brand spicy mayo on it. Everything I ordered from menu I could have personally made much better at home. I do not mind spending money on quality food, but I will never come back here because the food quality doesn‚Äôt match the price. Also I ordered a virgin mojito and they charged me the same price as it would be with liquor (realized this after I paid and left) .   Nice ambiance which is why I didn‚Äôt give it just 1 star. Also the waiter didn‚Äôt seem to know enough about the menu to give sound suggestions on what‚Äôs highly recommended."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 16, 2019",5,"We took my girlfriend for her birthday, we had lambchops,salt and pepper shrimp, veggie rice ,whole snapper, steak,and everyone enjoyed the food,,the topping to the evening was the RUM CAKE,OMG..ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS !!Will be returning with hubby"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 16, 2019",3,Went there based on a local news channel segment raving about how good this place was. Mostly a disappointment especially with the amount of money we paid for dumplings that were no better than takeout.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 16, 2019",5,"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this place. We greeted and seated quickly. Server Alex, came over with water and menus and introduced himself. We ordered the pastrami dumplings, absolutely awesome. Pork bao buns, also absolutely on point. We also had drinks, homemade mules, they were goood. For entrees the bachelor got the filet Mignon medium, my brother and I both had the ny strip. They came sizzling hot and were fantastic. We got side of fries and broccoli, only drawback no sides came with the meats. Totally worth the $, great service and food was on  point. Will be back again"
MeyHem,"Dined on June 14, 2019",5,Knowledgeable bar keeps. Service was professional and friendly. Food was outstanding. Enjoyed being there.
MonaB,"Dined on June 14, 2019",4,The steak was PERFECT - the appetizers were good but the sweet and sour eggplant is just all breading and was awful - and certainly there was not even one dollar's worth of eggplant.  It was a fired mess of breading - will never order it again and I suggest you take it off the menu!!!!!!!!!  Awful
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 12, 2019",1,"I had the worst experience yesterday! The waiter disregarded our order and brought us what he though was appropriate. He took 15 minutes to place our order. He forgot our drinks, and brushed off our request. I informed him this was a birthday dinner, he was suppose to sing happy birthday. He forgot to bring the cake, and did not sing happy birthday! The food was great, but the services was horrible. I‚Äôm so disappointed I hope they fire this waiter, he was anxious and displayed lack of confidence. People like this should not work in the Hospitality  Industry. I‚Äôm so mad I gave him a tip."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on June 10, 2019",5,Love this place every time! And the lamb chops are amazing!!!

Livy,"Dined on June 8, 2019",5,"The food was amazing, the service was great and fast!"
Sue201,"Dined on June 7, 2019",2,Food was very underwhelming! Bronzino was horrible. The black bass was good. All food was served lukewarm temperature which took away from the dinner. The red velvet cake was gross! Very heavy and artificial tasting. Drinks were decent. Ladies Bathroom was dirty! I do not recommend!
Rebecca,"Dined on June 7, 2019",5,Try the salad dressing that's a homemade 50 year old recipe from the chef. Its a garlic cream dressing AMAZING!!!!!!
DavidM,"Dined on June 6, 2019",2,"Everything was hugely overpriced. The Asian dishes were no better than you would get from a local takeaway.  3 people dining we had a starter and main each, two beers each and the bill was over $300.  Staff were great but this place is hugely overpriced"

SomeRandomName,"Dined on May 21, 2019",5,"Food was great.  Bigger portions than i expected.  I had the ribeye, fries and wedge salad.  Note if you are the type who wants steak and baked potato, they don't seem to serve baked potato."

MartiM,"Dined on May 18, 2019",4,"I‚Äôve been to this restaurant several times  and this time I was a little disappointed. I went there for brunch, the previous times I was there for dinner. The in restaurant brunch menu was different from the brunch menu on line. So a few items that were on the online menu were not available. In addition, there was a long hair in the flower arrangement on our table. I do plan to go back hoping maybe they were having an off day."
OutofTowner,"Dined on May 16, 2019",5,First time visit and I brought clients from overseas. Everything was excellent from the greeting to the food and the service. I will definitely recommend this place for lunch and certainly return.

AsiaW,"Dined on May 14, 2019",5,"The first time I came to Brooklyn chop house I was very disappointed with my service. But the service I received from this visit was amazing. The waiter name was Jay, he went above and beyond to make sure our visit was Amazing !!!! At most restaurants your waiter just brings the food out and leave; that‚Äôs something he didn‚Äôt do! He made sure each and everyone of us was okay with our food , drink and our overall day. Thank You again Jay !!!!"
MonetB,"Dined on May 13, 2019",3,If you don‚Äôt mind getting fresh cold food. The food was good but arrived 40 minutes after ordering and was cold. It was sent back and came back even colder

ZakiyaB,"Dined on May 12, 2019",4,Service was a bit slow. Staff members argued in front of us. The great food and strong drinks made up for unprofessionalism
IsaacJ,"Dined on May 12, 2019",5,Wonderful experience food was amazing good pricing
DaveS,"Dined on May 12, 2019",1,the food was horrible.  Same quality as an all you can eat buffet.  Was pre-prepared in bulk like an all you can eat buffet and came out 7 minutes after ordering.  Too many tables with very little walking room.   The service was decent but not enough to overcome the food.
shakai,"Dined on May 12, 2019",5,I love this place!!! This was my 2nd time here. I had the 18oz steak cooked medium but this time it was closer to medium well; still yummy though! Drinks are great!
JasonJ,"Dined on May 12, 2019",3,"Had to send back the overcooked steak, but the replacement was comped by the manager. Other items were good, not superb but good. There's a lot of hype to live up to."
Grand,"Dined on May 12, 2019",2,"Would not recommend with current level of service. Waited too long prior to having our order taken. Furthermore, we could not ask for our waiter by name because it was never provided. He also seemed very rushed while taking our order and inpatient with us asking questions about the menu. Lastly, I assume he left after his shift completed because we didn‚Äôt see him for the latter half of our dinning experience thus we had to flag someone else to provide our check"
TonyB,"Dined on May 12, 2019",4,Very Good Food...........................................................üëç
Maine,"Dined on May 12, 2019",3,"Great place with good vibes! However, the service was very slow took about 10 min to take our order for beverages and another 10 min to order the food. Received our drinks after getting our food and was not checked on throughout the time eating. Waiters was friendly just had to be flagged down for service."
Shanna201,"Dined on May 11, 2019",5,The food was delicious and the ambience was beautiful. This is definitely a good place for a date night or any night out of the week.
Jade,"Dined on May 11, 2019",5,"The service was friendly and fast. The restaurant itself was pleasant and cozy. The food was delicious and filling. Everything was shareable for at least 2 people.  The mango margaritas were really good. The chicken satays with peanut sauce were subtly delicious. The bacon cheeseburger dumplings were yummy. The filet mignon, ribs, and shrimp fried rice were oh so good. My family and I will definitely be back in the future."

RobinH,"Dined on May 8, 2019",5,Had a fabulous meal and the infusion of Asian cuisine was amazing.  I had plum sauce on my steak hell we put it everywhere. Great food great time!
JaaELL,"Dined on May 6, 2019",4,"I enjoyed dining with BCH. The bar service was great as well as each person I came in contact with. However, I realized some of the waiters seemed to have a disconnect. My waiter didn‚Äôt make a lot of eye contact which I think is a bit impersonal but otherwise did a great job of going over the menu with my husband and I as it was our first time.   Definitely will go again and recommend. Looking forward to the Hamptons opening."
Kira,"Dined on May 5, 2019",5,My first time here celebrating my bf birthday the food was amazing he enjoyed so did I ‚Äòthe drinks were great I feel the seats could have more space but overall it was great i will visit again after we finished eating the waitress gave us heated lemon grass rags for our hands I found that to be very nice she was very nice as well.. üëçüèæ will visit again

MandyS,"Dined on May 3, 2019",2,"The food was delicious. Who knew a french onion soup dumpling, asian-style, could work?! The atmosphere and the decor were very posh and comfortable. What disappointed was the service. The place was NOT packed for the lunch rush and we were a party of 3. There was no logical explanation for the lengthy wait time for our food.  The table of four next to us - they sat down before us and their food came by the time our entrees were done! We saw our waiter when he took our order and when we got up to leave.  And since we were running late to get back to work, due to the fact that our appetizers and entrees took extremely long to get out of the kitchen, we didn't realize we were overcharged until after we got back to the office. I called twice and received assurance our check and credit cards will be adjusted. A weekend and two business days later, nothing and at this point, it's simply the principle of it all. We had to return to the restaurant to resolve something that took less than 5 minutes."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 25, 2019",5,"This place has great food, great service and STRONG drinks!! I will definitely be going back. It‚Äôs a great spot for a nice date night or a dinner party."
noch90s,"Dined on April 25, 2019",1,"The food was bland, the service was slow and it wasn‚Äôt crowded the waiter did seem to know the menu to well."
PixieW,"Dined on April 25, 2019",3,The food was ok but not worth the price that they charged.
ShakimaM,"Dined on April 25, 2019",3,"I ordered a cheese burger, was not informed that it would be in the form of a dumpling and I did not see that on the menu that it was a dumpling, there really were no food choices to my liking"
DJWT,"Dined on April 21, 2019",5,Divine dining experience. Every dish prepared left us wanting more.
AntwanH,"Dined on April 20, 2019",5,The food was absolutely flavorful and so enjoyable
LatrishaA,"Dined on April 20, 2019",2,"It was OK, the food did not impress at all. Love the decor!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 14, 2019",3,"Food was actually pretty tasty. Unfortunately we found a dime size piece of hard plastic in our pork bun. They tried to charge us for two orders if it too until I had to say something. When I told the waiter he just starred at it and walked away- no comment. Also waiting 20 mins before I said, are we going to get a replacement ? Lol  The place has a lot of potential. Just need to QA and customer service training.  It‚Äôs pretty but strange."
Delegator,"Dined on April 14, 2019",4,"Having been to the Chop House for both dinner and dessert on Separate occasions, I have been pleased with the food and drink both times. The service for dinner was OK ‚Äî the waiter seemed a bit put off by some people in the party wanting just small plates and not entrees. The service when we were there for dessert and drinks was friendly and helpful. This place isn‚Äôt inexpensive, but it isn‚Äôt outlandish for the area. I guess the biggest surprise is that it is primarily Chinese cuisine, which isn‚Äôt something you would expect based on the name or decor."
BiancaB,"Dined on April 11, 2019",5,Beyond amazing food was great ambiance great service outstanding
JanilizV,"Dined on April 7, 2019",5,Went for date night. Filet Mignon was superb !!!! The appetizer was amazing (crispy chicken wonton) ... also the  Bao Buns were ok the stuffing tasted so juicy but the actual buns would need some type of honey glaze to it to add some ‚Äúuhmfff‚Äù ... the Satay chicken was too cooked so the texture was too bland maybe it was just the night (i bet it would taste great on a different day) ....  The shrimp fried rice was so tasteful and cooked just right and of course the drinks were just perfect & strong  (Aztec punch /mango mojito) ‚Äî- THE BEST PART WAS THE STAFF !!!! best restaurant thus far with the most attentive... cheerful and happy staff EVER!!! THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING DATE NIGHT !!
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on April 7, 2019",4,"First time visit.  Great decor. Staff was great. Food was ok. Onion rigs were sent back, undercooked and bland. No burgers (for kids) on dinner menu. Disappointed in steak/chop choices. I guess I was deceived a little by the name of the establishment."
BERGTRAUM7,"Dined on April 7, 2019",4,Date Night
MarieA,"Dined on April 2, 2019",5,Loved my experience!  The dining room was filled on a Monday which is always a good sign. We started with the crab soup and pac man seafood dumplings (which were multi colored and looked like the vintage arcade game‚Äôs cast of characters) and both were delicious and a great way to start dinner.  I opted for the green spinach shrimp which was unreal and my date got the sea-bass which melted in your mouth.  The GM Philip surprised us with an assortment of sorbets and at the end of the meal we said to each other we‚Äôll definitely be back.
LLstyles,"Dined on April 1, 2019",5,The food was amazingly delicious & the menu is extensive. Definitely going back next weekend to try out the rest of the delectable menu options !

Mc103,"Dined on March 23, 2019",3,"Ambiance was beautiful! Food was OK. Portions were really small. I ordered spicy kung pao with Chicken fried rice and broccoli. The kung pao was mostly breaded. There was barely any meat inside. Broccoli was basically raw with no seasoning, not even garlic. Service was really good. Drinks were good. Wouldn‚Äôt return."
MeishaB,"Dined on March 22, 2019",5,Excellent Service!!!! My dinner party sized changed last minute and they were able to accommodate us with no issues.

TiffanyT,"Dined on March 16, 2019",3,Wknds may be a bit of a wait even with a reservation but rhe food is worth the wait
RiaC,"Dined on March 15, 2019",5,"I'm was over from London and a few of my colleagues came with me for dinner. The quality of the food end to end was amazing. My favourites were the; philly cheesesteak dumplings, pork fried rice and mushrooms, then the apple Wontons. We had a lot more including the porterhouse and the cheesecake but these were our faves.  The service was prompt, professional and enjoyable."
RolandA,"Dined on March 15, 2019",3,Steaks were tough. Service was terrible. Waiter kept disappearing and the backup guy who was in training disappeared too
ChristineD,"Dined on March 11, 2019",5,"My boyfriend and I had an amazing date night this past Sunday evening! Food was amazing, service was great, and our waiter was very attentive and informative! After dinner, we went down the steps to the bar for a few drinks.. the bartender was awesome! She really cared to have a convo with her customers and she mixed me up a couple of drinks when I couldn‚Äôt make my mind up of what I wanted :) will definitely be back in the near future!"

JasmineT,"Dined on March 10, 2019",5,"Didn‚Äôt know it was the death anniversary of Biggie Smalls the day my friend and I made out reservations. We just wanted to eat spontaneously, the wait was crazy but it was well worth it. First and foremost I saw Faith Evans, Lil Ceaser, and a few other rappers . But enough of that the food was phenomenal! It was a great experience."
Charlee,"Dined on March 10, 2019",4,"There was a large party that held up reservations so the wait time was over an hour even with a reservation, which was displeasing. The amazing food and ambiance was absolutely amazing and despite the wait I would visit again. When there are long waits having management better communicate with waiting guests would be a plus!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 10, 2019",5,Food was good and nice decor
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 10, 2019",3,"Seems like an amazing restaurant to dine, which in fact it is. However, the space, seating, tables they cram you in is completely TERRIBLE. The staff will literally make tables everywhere & have you side by side next to another next to customer-table, and won‚Äôt allow you to have an intimate & private conversation. Great and EXCELLENT food, the waiter was NOT pleasant, ambiance super"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 10, 2019",5,I had a reservation at 9:45 and didn‚Äôt sit down until 11:30. They hostess gave me a free champagne glass which I really enjoyed. Love the food.
TF2019,"Dined on March 10, 2019",2,The noise level was excessively high. The music was too loud.
Mack,"Dined on March 10, 2019",4,$125 for a steak that was just burnt with no flavor profile at all. The lobster rice was good the chicken satay was not. The drinks are very good. So basically $200 for rice and the drinks. Definitely not a steak house quality meal. I was disappointed after having such great expectations. They staff was great as welll. Just that the steak was not good at all.
DeishaB,"Dined on March 10, 2019",3,The food is great the ambiance is great the price was great but my server was terrible. I would still Recommend you go just don‚Äôt get My server.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 10, 2019",5,Loved it! The food is amazing!!!!
Jimbo,"Dined on March 10, 2019",2,"Service too slow, and food came out in waves such that last person got his food almost 10 minutes after everyone else. Drinks also sat empty for far too long with no server in sight. Also, many items listed on their website‚Äôs dinner menu were in fact only available for lunch. Basically an overpriced Asian restaurant, we would have been better served going to Chinatown."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on March 9, 2019",5,"Aaaaaazig!  To the moment we stepped inside, the staff we wonderful. The bar had great patrons and we were glad we got to meet a few. The bartender was a great guy, busy yet friendly.   We got seat and had a great server who guided us through the menu as to not order too much food.   The food. The dumplings were an amazing twist and we delightful. Our crispy filet was cooked perfectly!    I can‚Äôt wait to recommend this place to everyone."

Sweetstase,"Dined on March 6, 2019",4,We dined at Brooklyn Chophouse for birthday celebrations. The birthday persons were very impressed by the restaurant ambiance and food. Made my heart smile since I was the one who chose the restaurant. They all said they will return again.

KeithT,"Dined on March 5, 2019",3,I really enjoyed my food but the service was fall under one of the WORSE Ive experienced in a long time.  The staff is not attentive at all.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 25, 2019",1,The place wasnt even busy and i had to go find my waiter to pay the bill. Food was terrible and overpriced. Stay away. The place looked cool tho.
Danisha,"Dined on February 24, 2019",5,"Great food. My group had the surf and turf, duck tacos, shrimp and spinach dumplins which were amazing, crispy lobster wontons, also delicious, black bean bejing chicken, delicious, the philly cheese steak dumplins are okay. Loud atmosphere, and tables are pretty tight! Not a spacey place. It gets packed on the weekend!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 24, 2019",5,Service was great as well as the food drinks were on poin strong as well
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 24, 2019",5,Made a reservation for dinner with some out of town visitors. The menu was creative and the food tasted amazing. Was a great twist on classic dim sum. Will definitely be going again
NikiaE,"Dined on February 24, 2019",4,"On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give Brooklyn Chop House an 8. The food was delicious we ordered the 24 oz. bone in rib eye, pan fried chicken dumplings, lobster fried rice, and duck. The rib eye was delicious and the sauce that was Asian steak sauce and very tasty. The duck is prepared and carved table side which is a wonderful plus and very rich tasty along with the pancakes, wonton taco's and hoisan sauce. The pan fried dumplings were awesome! My only disappointment was the lobster fried rice in which I recommend not to order as it barely had any lobster in it and the pieces that were in it were microscopic so this was very disappointing.  The tables are pretty close to one another as well so if you're not comfortable almost eating in an almost communal setting it might not be the place for you.  The wait staff is very professional and knowledgeable about the selections and they don't hover over you and they check on you appropriately.  I would definitely go back but never ordering the $27 lobster fried rice that's missing lobster!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 24, 2019",5,Great food and service.

dwayne,"Dined on February 17, 2019",3,"I reserved a table for 11:15, when I arrived I still had to wait until about 12 a.m to be seated? Once I was seated it literally took 1hr and 22min before my food arrived and to my surprise with the amount of money I spent ‚Äúwe‚Äù received small portions. The place is pretty congested on a Saturday and wasn‚Äôt the best 1st time experience."
AyannaD,"Dined on February 17, 2019",3,"Went to this restaurant on Saturday, February 16th for my bestfriends Birthday it was recommended to me by another friend who enjoyed her time at the there. I made a reservation for 9:30pm didn't get seated until around 10:30. The restaurant was packed and the hosts seemed overwhelmed because their were so many people waiting to be seated. When the hostess finally seated us we were crammed into an area that barely fit all 3 of us. The tables were super close to one another and she didn't even pull the table out so that my friend could squeeze in to her seat. Once seated we had a server that appeared to be new because she kept forgetting drinks and seemed flustered. I had to ask her what were the most popular dishes since it had been our first time there. So instead of telling me the most popular dishes she proceeded to tell me about each different steak. Drinks took forever to come out appetizers came out at a decent time they were delicious. We received our entrees about 25mins after that, I expected to have a better experience with this restaurant. I know some restaurants have good and bad days so I will possibly give this place another chance."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 17, 2019",2,"Made a reservation for 7:30p , never got seated until 8:45p. When we finally was seated we get stuck by the kitchen so there was extra traffic there. Then our food came late so  we really lost our appetite. The manager compensated 3 drinks but bu that time I was over the whole experience."
ZRai,"Dined on February 17, 2019",5,My first visit at Brooklyn Chop House was excellent! I loved everything and will be back soon.
trymanythings,"Dined on February 17, 2019",3,Very over priced very tight space lobster wintins where great cheesburger did not tasye like a cheeseburger and roast duck they tried to cut off breast meat and keep the rest i like the bone and had to request to get my own bone that i paid 65$for
HarlemGirl147,"Dined on February 16, 2019",5,Love everything about this place.  Food is always superb! Definitely one of my favorite spots.
ZmanNYC,"Dined on February 16, 2019",2,"We waited 30 minutes for our table despite having reservations. That would have been relatively okay, but the bartenders were unprofessional and distracted and we had a tough time getting drinks. A couple near us said the same thing, so it was not just our experience. They told us they would never come back. Neither would we. Waitstaff wasn‚Äôt much better. The whole place seemed disorganized. For example, they brought out dinner out twice!  Lol  As for the food, it was fair. Steakhouse with Asian flair. I would say it was PF Chang type of food and quality.  No offense to PF Chang‚Äôs.  I like that place for what it is.  Just don‚Äôt charge Peter Luger‚Äôs prices for PF Chang food.   Very disappointing, which is too bad because it‚Äôs a pretty place.   Overall, terrible disappointment"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 16, 2019",4,Everything went well food was great!! Waitress was a little off had to wait al long time for my drink and she didn‚Äôt even come back until it was time to pay the bill!!
CharleneW,"Dined on February 16, 2019",5,Very chill vibe and great food. Drinks are strong
MarvB,"Dined on February 15, 2019",3,Waited way to long and they forgot are drinks and chicken we had to tel them and the food was a little salty
AsiaW,"Dined on February 15, 2019",2,"The establishment is very nice and worth the view. But the service was very poor, we waited over an hour and 50 mins for the food to come out. We even order sushi which is raw, that took 45 mins to come out. I was looking forward to having a nice night out but the service made me want to leave before I even got my food."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 15, 2019",2,"Long wait for entrees, I think they may have forgotten about us.  Our table placement was terrible has waiters squeezing by on both sides of us basically every second of the meal.  Food was subpar for the price."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 15, 2019",5,Great experience and good vibes
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 15, 2019",5,Valentine‚Äôs Day food Was amazing
Traci,"Dined on February 15, 2019",5,The food was excellent. Service was a little slow because I came at a time when the shift was changing but the service I did get from the hostess and second waitress was exceptional.
DarrellS,"Dined on February 13, 2019",5,Great food and ambience was terrific for our outing. I would recommend for all of my friends. The service was very attentive and knowledgeable. Five stars definitely and will return sooner than later.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 10, 2019",2,"Waited over an hour to be seated even with reservattions. The place was jam packed, the steak was horrible and the branzino was not good"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 10, 2019",5,I can‚Äôt say enough good things about my experience! Went for my birthday and my family & myself were treated really good. Food was very good & seasoned well. Strong drinks. Worth the money.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 10, 2019",5,"Food was amazing. Went for anniversary dinner. Vibe was cool, not necessarily romantic but we aren‚Äôt really super PDA so it was perfect. Good for groups as well."
MichelleA,"Dined on February 10, 2019",5,The food was amazing! The staff was friendly on explaining their menu and specials of the day! If you want a calmer atmosphere I suggest reservations  before 7:30. I also recommend the French onion dumpling and Peking duck for the entree! Will definitely be back to try the other dumplings.
SatifiedCustoner,"Dined on February 10, 2019",4,Deserve 5 stars but minus for their prices.  Which were very pricey for appetizers and drinks
TrangC,"Dined on February 10, 2019",1,Worst experience- food was not as described - seafood dumpling was suppose to be a variety of seafood but it all tasted like shrimp; and beef noodles were greasy and the beef didn‚Äôt taste like real beef; service was even worst - no clear waiter; waited for 20min to get a glass of wine and when the waiter showed up he was rude and exasperated. I left feeling they had better things to do; well so did I. To top it off managment tried to fix things via a phone message that stated the waiter knew we were upset and just waited to give us time to calm down. My friend and I are two women; neither of us raised our voices; we stated the facts in a calm fashion. Just the sheer fact they thought we had to calm down makes me think this place is run by sexist men; please my money is as good as any guy. Oh yeah forgot about the rather large chunk of bone I found in my meal of which the waiter didn‚Äôt acknowledge until I stated (in a calm voice) that an apology is due rather then him walking away ignoring the issue.  So my reco is to run away from this place.
SteveJ,"Dined on February 9, 2019",5,"So good. Everything we had was delicious. The more people the better, this way you can try more of their dim sum/small plate options."
JORDANH,"Dined on February 9, 2019",5,Stratus was amazing and made my boyfriend and I very comfortable. He even moved us from the middle of the floor to a cozier corner away from the traffic. Extra bonus points for that we for sure will be back..
ShaniB,"Dined on February 9, 2019",5,Made reservations through open table. Arrived on time. Seated within 15 minutes. Hostess found us by the bar and escorted us to our table. Food was good. Nice ambience.
DENISEL,"Dined on February 9, 2019",5,Even with a reservation still had a 45 minute wait to be seated
Roblo4501,"Dined on February 9, 2019",3,Didnt care for this place at all!!
Susan,"Dined on February 9, 2019",3,The food at Brooklyn Chophouse was very good. The main issue is space. There are too many tables and barely enough space to get in and out without disturbing your neighbors. We were also seated by the server's station which meant they were constantly by our table inputting orders and putting away table settings. Not sure I would go back for dinner because it would make me claustrophobic.
Talyse1,"Dined on February 9, 2019",5,Great experience. Amazing food  Gave service low rating because no one came up to take our order for at least 20-30 minutes. Seemed as if waitress didn‚Äôt want to serve us but the waitress we did end up getting was phenomenal  Waited 2 hours for food so she comped the sides.  Great ambiance too!
DentDiva,"Dined on February 8, 2019",2,I was just overall disappointed with the service & the food.
JadeG,"Dined on February 8, 2019",2,Service was pretty good. Food just took long to come out. Not a place to go on a hour lunch break. Nice place and would go back.
Tasty,"Dined on February 8, 2019",3,"Nice design and nice restaurant environment.There really were conditions for a good restaurant visit.   But what does it help when the service is filthy and  uninterested.Much can be forgiven but when the food is meager and uninspiring, not much helps to save the visit."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 8, 2019",5,The food is always on point. Highly recommend. Also parking is super easy to find.
AlisaC,"Dined on February 8, 2019",5,"From reading a few of the posts, I expected to wait upon arrival, but this was so not the case, we were seated immediately. Our waitress Christine was amazing and the food was awesome. I will definitely return & I highly recommend it."

CamilleD,"Dined on February 6, 2019",5,My family and I loved the ambiance! I wish David and Don Poo lots of prosperity and abundance.
Tash,"Dined on February 6, 2019",2,"I must say Brooklyn Chophouse has a wonderful cuisine and my tastebuds were thoroughly impressed..when I finally was attended to. I was so disappointed in the quality of service is such an eclectic looking restaurant. I literally waited 25 minutes just to finally be offered water for the table and then our table was ignored again for another 10 minutes. To the point where I physically had to leave the table and get a drink at the bar and watched the supposed server looking bored standing by the bar and she asked me how im doing as I caught her eye and I was just in shock with her non chalant attitude. When she finally came back to our table it was just to tell us she's not serving us anymore and threw someone named Daniel on us as if she couldn't be bothered. Thank god she did that because he was a breath of fresh air and he made up for what she was lacking. Overall, it's hard to recommend anyone as I am not sure if the service has improved, im hoping that was an isolated incident but it surely didn't leave the best impression on me or my best friend that dined with me."

Britt,"Dined on February 3, 2019",1,My waitress was super rude and annoying (kept bothering me interrupting our conversation)
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2019",4,"Ive eaten their twice now. This was the 1st time on a Friday night. I would suggest you have a reservation. It gets hectic for walkins. Beyond that, the food and service was EXCEPTIONAL. I highly recommend it."
NicolletteL,"Dined on February 2, 2019",2,"Don‚Äôt bother making a reservation, they don‚Äôt follow through. It‚Äôs like going to doctors office and getting seen 3 hours later. Reservation was for 9 got seated at 1030. They kept bringing my food to another table, I ordered a drink and asked them to remake it twice because it was watered down from being at the bar station waiting for pick up. The only thing saving this place is that the food was honestly very good. When I finally did get my food it was hot and good. I was waiting over 2 hours for my appetizer and ended up taking it home since I paid for it."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2019",2,"The reservation was for 830pm We arrived at 745pm, we didn‚Äôt get seated until 930 we were told by the greeter that we would receive a complimentary glass of champagne because the restaurant over booked we didn‚Äôt receive the champagne. We ordered the vegetable fried rice it was over cooked, the sea bass bao bun was ok and bland, broccoli was good, Caesar salad was put together poorly and the fries was too salty, the veggie spring rolls were tasty"
ChrisC,"Dined on February 2, 2019",1,"Brooklyn Chop House grossly over booked. It was very sad. Most people waited over an hour to get a table with RSVP. I personally waited 1hr 40min!!!! And they were still taking RSVP online. Disgusting. Then service was extremely slow and meats were cooked like tires. They seem to cater to anyone who the feel is ""somebody"" or celebrity like. Little do they know! üòâ ..they acted the same way @ Jade Sixty smh..Anyways I'll never return here even if it's for free."
Jess,"Dined on February 2, 2019",1,Seated 1.5 hours after reservation. Not worth the wait for mediocre food. Every single table around us sent their food back. Nothing like I‚Äôve ever seen before.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on February 2, 2019",3,"We had a 8pm reservation and were not seated until 930. We got a complimentary glass of cheap champagne while we waited and got appetizers and drinks at the bar. The food was good and came quickly but it too a long time for us to get serviced at the bar. We had the steak and sea bass which was very good. Dessert wasn‚Äôt at all impressive, we shared a red velvet cake. The bathrooms had only 2 stalls and one was out of order. They really need to have more ladies bathrooms."
SundayDinner,"Dined on February 2, 2019",4,"Service, food and drinks were great - a bit of a back up with seating at the door, which I am sure they will work out in time. Still a fairly new restaurant that has definitely already come along way from their opening. Definitely intend to dine here more often. Food is delicious."
Sabr,"Dined on February 2, 2019",1,"Food was great, service was not. Waitress was very inattentive, we waited an outrageous amount of time for the waitress to come over when we were first seated and for the check. First and last time going."
GloriaG,"Dined on February 2, 2019",4,"We were very disappointed with the service, our waiter seemed distracted. Our food arrived only after i asked the servers , there were a group that came after us and their food arrived a few minutes after they were seated. When i asked for the check, our waiter gave me a stern YES! That was reLly unexpected. Even the couple seated next to us could not believe what they just heard!!! Will never return nor recommend this place."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 31, 2019",5,"NY Strip, crispy rice, garlic broccoli were great and cooked perfectly.  Our server was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu.  Nice to have this new addition to dining options in FiDi.  Only thing that needs improvement is their desserts: lava cake was missing the chocolate ""lava"" and was really just a piece of chocolate cake."
WayneR,"Dined on January 31, 2019",5,"I Love coming to this Restaurant!!!  The French Onion Soup Dumplings are incredible!!!

It's so worth it!"
DanG,"Dined on January 27, 2019",1,"Highly disappointed. The waitress didn't know what she was talking about in regards to the frying of the steaks and lobsters. The food took forever to come and when the food finally came it was all wrong, the drinks were small and skimpy. The dinner bill was over $500 for 4 people and I have nothing good to say about this place."
ShawnaLynn52,"Dined on January 27, 2019",5,Excellent food and exceptional service!  The ambiance was fantastic.  I will be returning back and I will definitely recommend.
BrandiJ,"Dined on January 27, 2019",2,"Nice space,  cool ambience the food looked good but was just okay, nothing to brag about. Pricy chinese food in my opinion,  everything was the same flavor soy, garlic, ginger.... garlic ginger soy. Was something to do,  i've been wanting to go but I wasn't impressed. My guys filet mignon was bland.  Service was excellent but I have no desire to go back."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 26, 2019",4,was pretty good. Long wait for a seat even with reservation but in all great time
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 26, 2019",3,Filthy dirty beer glass.  Returned for money back.   Waiter who interrupted the order taking to ‚Äúbe right back‚Äù   Cold main course.   Noisy   Uneven flooring at main entrance.    Pretty good music.   Nice steak knives.
Gigi,"Dined on January 26, 2019",5,Awesome night! Only thing we ended up getting a ticket...
ShariJ,"Dined on January 26, 2019",4,"We decided to try Brooklyn chop house for NYC Restaurant Week 2019. The food and drinks were exceptional however they did run out of certain items for desert. Our waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable about the food. Unfortunately, our main course took forever to be served. Our waiter apologized for the delay and gave us a free round of drinks which was greatly appreciated."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 26, 2019",5,"On a Friday night make a reservation and prepare to wait. Noisiest wheel gets the oil here. There was a guy with no reservation but he called 10 mins before he came and was told to come but now he had to wait. One host was quite concerned with finding him a table rather than addressing  those holding a reservation, arrived on time, and was still waiting. I had an 8:30 Res arrived at 8:20 and didn't  get seated until 8:50. Not sure the point of reservations here. I have been here twice now. During the week its busy, but so far Friday is very busy. Wait service has been 50/50 btwn the two visits, one excellent  the other awful and unattentive, both were friendly. The food is always good. I think it is over priced. The portions are normal. The quality of food is amazing, making the price reasonable. The steaks look amazing look forward to trying them next time. Dumplings were great. Green spinach shrimp dumplings  have whole shrimp not minced, yay! Cheesesteak dumplings  were tasty. Beef and broccoli, Crispy beef, was good. Drinks were okay, 1st drink was watered down, second drink better. The Friday energy is completely  turned up.  Definitely  will go again on a Friday but need to figure out the waiting for a Res thing."
K423,"Dined on January 26, 2019",5,Nice calm spot to go on a date
JannyB,"Dined on January 26, 2019",2,"I was looking forward to our visit after hearing people talk about it, but was disappointed by our visit.  I came for Restaurant Week since it was an opportune time to check it out and it was clear that they were trying to promote it since I had to ask if the had the menu for it.  I dined elsewhere earlier in the week and the restaurant included the menu with the regular menu.  We ordered from that menu and the regular menu and while the pastrami dumplings were great, the strip steak lacked flavor.  The Filet Mignon Sandwich was tasty, but on the small size for a hungry guy.  Sidenote: the waitress entered the sandwich order in wrong so we had to wait for it since they brought out a steak.  They also brought out white rice instead of fried rice.  I had a spicy mango margarita, which simply tasted like spicy mango juice with no tequila.  The best part of the restaurant is the space.  It's super sexy and the music was good, but it's NYC and you can find that anywhere.  Definitely won't be going back."

I walked in while he went to park and the hostess showed me to the lounge area to wait for him. As soon as he came in, we were seated immediately. We had a waiter and and waitress tend to us. They were both so friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. The drinks were tasty, the food was delicious, and the overall ambiance was amazing! Will definitely be coming again!"

CassidyB,"Dined on January 21, 2019",1,"This place has so much potential. Space is beautiful, good food but HORRIBLE service.  Went for brunch on Sunday, there were more servers then tables in the room but they could not handle it.  We waited 10 minutes to even order drinks, then to order brunch.  Our food came before our drinks....every time our food came out it went to the wrong table. Staff was so unprofessional, food runners seemed high.  After we finished eating and were waiting another 15 minutes for our 2nd round of drinks, a staff member came by and asked if ""we were gucci.""   Just a really awkward and disappointing experience."

Cscruggs,"Dined on January 16, 2019",4,I enjoyed my birthday here. The N.y. Strip steak was cooked just right. The chicken chinese fried rice for two was tasty and the metal canister that it was contained in was cute. Loved my lychee martini although it was a little too sweet . Our server Patenda was great . The only complaint I have is that in my reservation I said it was my birthday and that I wanted a candle in a dessert.
Lunabee,"Dined on January 14, 2019",5,Great lunch!  We chose the prix fixe.  Onion soup dumplings and veggie rolls to start.  Dumplings were delicious.  Perfect starter for a cold day.  Next beef with broccoli and black bean chicken. Chicken was perfectly spiced. Not too sweet. Small bite sized tender chunks.  Beef also well seasoned and broccoli still crunchy.  Dessert fried apple filled dumplings with vanilla ice cream. To die.  Service was attentive although kitchen was somewhat slow. We were not in a hurry so it was all good.  Will certainly go again.
JoiW,"Dined on January 14, 2019",5,"Love this place, dumplings are AMAZING. Everytime I eat there the owner comes to the table, Hes a wonderful man!  Lobster Fried Rice is my Fave,  Philly Cheese Dumplings and Broccoli!"

SUeda,"Dined on January 10, 2019",3,"Please note, this is my first review at OpenTable and regularly dine throughout the United States and abroad for both business and leisure.  I am leaving this review since I was thoroughly disappointing by the waitress and wanted to inform any potential guests who plan on hosting a business dinner of the lack of professionalism and training at the venue.  The overall food and experience was good however the waitress was terrible.  The waitress didn't provide an opportunity to taste the wine despite ordering both expensive reds and whites and just began pouring for the table.  Once the table was done ordering, I had asked about sides in order to complete the order and whether we had enough food and provided guidance that ended up with the table with 8 orders of rice (2 per serving) for a table of 9.  The waitress approached the guests and not the host when there were timing issues in the kitchen. Lastly, she was serving peking duck and began using her unwashed hands and touched the pancakes.  The food, the concept and the experience are great but the waitress clearly needs training.  I realize this wasn't a 3-star Michelin restaurant but this was a steakhouse in the Financial District in New York City and she was barely serviceable in a TGI Fridays at a airport."
Mizcity,"Dined on January 9, 2019",3,"Venue is nicely decorated. In an area lacking steakhouses, it would benefit from sticking to that niche with a mid level price point instead of trying to incorporate Asian fusion. The name chophouse is a bit misleading. It‚Äôs hard to do Asian fusion well when you have Chinatown not far away. Service has some kinks to work out. Did not drink but the bar looks like a cute area to grab one."
TJohn,"Dined on January 8, 2019",5,"I loved the relaxed feel of the restaurant.  It was very comfortable dining. I would definitely return to try more dishes. All of dishes we tried were good - spring rolls, salad and french onion soup dumplings.  Service was a little slow and the waitress was not that welcoming but the food was good and affordable."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on January 8, 2019",4,"En general bueno. La comida buena, pero un poco caro para la oferta gastron√≥mica realmente."

MJSENAT,"Dined on January 6, 2019",3,"My shrimp had so much breading by the time I got to the shrimp, they weren't really prawns, just extra large shrimp. Drinks were good. Our server, Sue,  was good too."
Young,"Dined on January 6, 2019",3,"The service was very slow and staff were disorganized. Food was alright. The dumplings are overrated. The concept of a steak house with Asian influence is poorly executed in terms of menu and incorporation of cuisine. Given the price, it is not particularly a good value.   I don't think I will visit again."
TamaraB,"Dined on January 6, 2019",2,The waiting for the food and waitress to take our order was not good and should have been  better!
Toi727,"Dined on January 5, 2019",5,The food was sooo good. The ambiance was just right. I really enjoyed it
Citigal,"Dined on January 5, 2019",4,"Should try at least once.  Beautiful space but uncomfortable seating, nowhere to put anything.  I understand need to maximize space given Manhattan real estate prices, but at least have a coat check option in winter.  The man at the station by the door was on the phone when we walked in and didn't bother to acknowledge us.  He was busy reading things off the menu to whoever was on the phone.  Another woman showed up after a minute and seated us.  Since one of the selling points is dim sum and small plate options for sharing, tables are not especially geared for that.  Two of us ordered 4 items and it barely fit on the table as it all came out at once.  We cleared a plate to make more room.  The bacon cheeseburger dumplings were on the salty side but juicy.  The pac man dumplings were cute in presentation but uninspiring in flavor, basically a dressed up ""har gow"" (shrimp dumpling).  The peking duck tacos were tasty.  The rice was not ""crispy"" in the soft shell crab crispy rice but it was good.  The apple wontons for dessert were delicious.  Drinks are creative but no happy hour prices at the tables.  Also, if you're seated near the larger tables, servers bring one of those folding trays when their food is brought out so you feel like you're hovering over somewhere else's food.  Overall, the experience was enjoyable.  Not sure it's a ""must repeat"" but would certainly go back if option arises."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 29, 2018",4,"Came here for our 24th wedding anniversary. Hosts were great except a big part of the restaurant was semi empty and they sat a large group literally right next to us. We even went early so it would be a little romantic. Service was just ok. The bus staff was on point and our water glasses never went empty, but our waitress never told us her name and was very inattentive. The wait staff was standing at the end of the dining area talking to each other. That and having the big group sat right next to us with plenty of space available is the only thing that brings the rating down. The food and drinks were unbelievable! I would eat here again just for the food. We had bacon cheeseburger dumplings, crispy vegetable rice for two, Kung Pao chicken and beef and broccoli. I can't even tell you what kind of beef it was because it melted in your mouth and I've never tasted anything like it before. Absolutely amazing! They even brought out a dessert for our anniversary. I would highly recommend! We will be back if they can get their service to match the food experience."

EnglishmaninNY,"Dined on December 27, 2018",3,Good enough place. Food is good but the steak - which is supposed to be their signature dish - was too fatty and disappointing. Service was also below expectations - both during meal (wait was way too long) and at reception

DarienneK,"Dined on December 24, 2018",1,We‚Äôre local and started coming here vs Mr Chow - the vibe and scene has changed since it opened. We have dined here a few times and brought friends from out of town. An unfortunate scene occurred when my husband entered the men‚Äôs room this evening to a drug conversation. It definitely brought to consciousness that this wasn‚Äôt the place we thought it was going to be. It has degraded each visit and several events we thought might be appropriate to bring here have made us think differently. We will not be returning. Not our scene. We enjoy good food and an enjoyable environment - this establishment not longer embodies this for us.

TerrellC,"Dined on December 23, 2018",5,I love supporting BLACK OWE RESTAURANT. He did a fantastic job coming from the person I knew to developing himself into something great. I‚Äôm very proud of him. That soul food twist with Asian incorporated was not a good choice for my group. We automatically thought of good soul food and the Asian twisted made it something too unknown. I‚Äôm a foodie so I like to go to the best when I choose a particular type of food. This combo didn‚Äôt mixes well for us especially for the price. Everything was absolutely amazing other than the most important reason why I came. The FOOD
Chakag,"Dined on December 22, 2018",3,"Our table was in extremely busy location in the middle of a walkway... we asked for our seat to be changed they told us that table was booked for a big party, then 15 minutes later a party of 2 (same size as our party) was seated there. The food was good. The head waiter was dismissive. And it took long to be greeted initially and pretty much the flow was slow.  The drinks were ok. Oh and no parking just a parking lot only $25 tho. Would I come back? Probably not."

Eteam,"Dined on December 20, 2018",1,"Appetizers were okay but  no better than a corner Chinese take out.  Entrees were lousy, especially the Drunkin Bronzino.  Pieces of fish floating in a sweet, luke warm gelatin.  Where did they get this chef? My co worker could not eat the Bass sandwich.  She thought it was too oily.  Very overpriced for this type of food.  Even the presentation was weak for a place like this.  Like a said, you can do much better at a local  take out joint for a fraction of the price."
Sheryl,"Dined on December 18, 2018",4,"Welcoming interior, and creative combination of Asian & steakhouse themes. Onion Soup Dumplings were a fun twist, and the prixe fix lunch deal is a great value.  The server was very nice, but was inaccurate describing a couple of dishes -- will chalk that up to the restaurant being new."
Jmel21,"Dined on December 18, 2018",3,"This Chop House is not what you expect. Staff was less than welcoming despite it not being terribly busy when we arrived. We were made to wait for our reservation despite obviously open tables.  Tables are right on top of each other and noise is high.  Took the waiter quite a while to ask for drinks and to bring menus.  The food was good, not quite worth the price but tasty with surprising combinations available.  The shrimp fried rice, the short rib buns and the ginger beef noodles were all good.  The steaks were nicely seasoned and properly cooked. Having thought we were going to a steak house we got a different experience.  If they can improve service it could be a decent alternative to the typical steak house."

Diningindmv,"Dined on December 14, 2018",1,"In the words of Kurtz from Joseph Conrad‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeart of Darkness‚Äù...the horror...the horror.  Without a doubt the worst restaurant experience we have ‚Äúdined‚Äù at in many years.  The staff were very gracious, but were eclipsed by what we assume was the manager/owner who was bragging about opening ‚ÄúPhilippe‚Äù. Never heard of it, but we can only hope the food was better than the school cafeteria fare served to us.  We ordered the chicken satay which had a very odd color and taste and was nowhere near the menu description. I would recommend reading the reviews on Yelp and OpenTable before booking. What a disappointment!"
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on December 13, 2018",1,The food is great but everything else is so bad you forget about the great food.  I was so excited when it open in my neighborhood but wont be heading back anytime soon.   My reservation was for 7:15 and was finally seated at 7:50 and with no apologies.  After complaining I got 1 drink complimentary.   The server messed up our order and and did not place our entree order.  When we inquired about it we she said we never ordered it.  After a long back and forth she finally place the order.  This place is only focused on large groups which are loud and acting like it is a private party space which ruins the experience for everyone else.  The tables for 2 are so badly placed you are bumped into all night by the staff.  The owner is clearly not trying to make this a neighborhood place.  My compliments to the chef but everyone else needs to be trained and taught hospitality!!!
MJSENAT,"Dined on December 12, 2018",3,"Our waiter was just not attentive, and it wasn't even crowded .  Kept forgetting condiments, extra utensils.  food was fair this time. very shock"
BashiraH,"Dined on December 11, 2018",5,I love this restaurant. I've been there twice and plan on going back plenty of more times. Everything that I ate was so good and I got something different each time so I could see how it taste and it was great. I told all of my friends about it and they also love it too.
carolh,"Dined on December 8, 2018",3,"The space is really nice but tables are very tight, and service was extremely slow (although they re trying and they re over staffed ). Took 45 minutes wait between appetizer and main dish. Menu is eclectic with lots of choices. Some of the dishes are good, but overall very greasy. Didn‚Äôt particularly enjoy the experience."
DLVATL,"Dined on December 7, 2018",2,"Menu was interesting...kind of hard to make sense of how much food we needed to order.  I ordered dumplings and a small plate...both of which came BEFORE my husbands meal.  So I ate slow so that we were eating at the same time and then all my food was cold when he finally got his steak (Which we had to ask and remind them to bring it to the table).  People tried to clear my food 3 times while we were waiting for his food to be brought.  We watched food be brought to the wrong tables 3 times while we were there and we also saw people start their meal and then asked to be moved because they didn't like where they were sitting.  Seating is awkward, the staff is constantly bumping into each other....all very strange  We wanted to like it but I doubt we will go back."
LisaM,"Dined on December 7, 2018",4,"The dumplings and dim sum were outstanding!  the main courses (hamburger, crispy beef) were ok.  Would come back for drinks and dim sum but not dinner.  Also dining room was very tight - too many tables."

RufusD,"Dined on December 4, 2018",5,This place is great for entertaining someone you'd like to impress. The food can get a bit pricey for the portion though. A serviced of rice for two is really only enough for one person.

Disappointment,"Dined on December 2, 2018",2,"The dumplings were fantastic, but the burger was incredibly greasy and did not taste particularly great. The service was awful - at one point we gave up trying to flag our waiter down and started going to the register to pay because we‚Äôd been waiting 20+ minutes.  I will not come back due to the service and would not recommend the burger, but the dumplings were absolutely awesome."
JessArt,"Dined on December 2, 2018",3,"Upon arrival (on time at 7:30pm), we were checked in by a young lady at the front desk and was told we would be seated soon.  While standing by the desk, the hostess walked up and proceeded to take a customer who walked in after us, late for a 6:45pm reservation.    The same hostess returned again, never acknowledged my husband and I standing at the desk waiting to be seated.  Another couple walked in for a 7:30 reservation after us.  The hostess then recognized the gentleman and proceeded to greet him with a hug.  She then turned to the young lady at the desk and said, ‚ÄúLet me take them first‚Äù.  She never greeted us or even gave us eye contact.  At that point, we were waiting for fifteen minutes to be seated.  I requested to speak to a manager.  I was then approached by a gentleman who asked if we wanted to be seated before seeing a manager in which I declined.  Surprisingly, the same hostess who initially ignored us approached me and asked if she could help me with anything, I declined again asking to speak to a manager for the second time.  Finally, the manager Philippe appeared and immediately seated us after I told him what transpired when we checked in.  Having experience in the restaurant/hotel industry, I must say that this was not a good first impression on this new establishment at all.  Thankfully, our server Daniel was excellent and made us feel comfortable.  I want to say he saved the day after a horrible start at the front of the house.  During our dining experience, I was met with not so nice looks from both the hostess and gentleman who attempted to resolve my issue before having to call a manager.     Upon our departure, the hostess gave us a dirty look then walk away from the desk without a farewell or any parting words.  The young lady who checked us in told us to have a wonderful evening.    Staff is a huge reflection on any establishment and if they are not professional or trained properly, it can definitely result in negative reviews."

ElaineB,"Dined on December 1, 2018",4,Nice place for a casual brunch
MayaT,"Dined on December 1, 2018",2,We waited an hour even though we had a reservation.The seating process seemed disorderly with patrons who arrived after us seated before we were because they were more vocal about their long wait. The food was mediocre at best. The steak for two entree was burnt and very salty which is unusual for a Dry Aged Steak. Definitely not the service or food quality expected for a restaurant at that price point.
MoKa,"Dined on December 1, 2018",5,Went to Chophouse for the first time Friday night. Took a while to get seated even with a reservation but there was an open spot at the bar so we didn‚Äôt mind. Great lychee martinis. Great food. Great dessert. Would definitely recommend.

Being that it was an hour before closing it was pretty quiet which I loved! Food was great service was good.. But the manager was so rude to the waitstaff..

LauraD,"Dined on November 18, 2018",1,"We had a reservation for 8pm, arrived at 7:45am and finally left at 9:30pm when our table was still not ready.  No one came to speak to us, apologize to us or offer drinks. Everytime we went to the host stand, we were told the table would be ready in 3 minutes.  Finally when we refused to buy the drinks we had, they paid our bar tab, but only after much pleading.  Luckily we found a table at a restaurant nearby at 9:45pm.  This was a celebration for two birthdays and the evening was ruined."
Luv2eat,"Dined on November 18, 2018",4,We had a wonderful dinner - my only complaint was I asked for my filet mignon black & blue and it was not so I had to sit and wait for another while everyone else ate.  They also never brought mushrooms but they were on the bill so had to change that.  I know the restaurant is new so I will overlook.  See private comment below.

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 14, 2018",1,"The restaurant had more tables than it should because there was no room for wait staff to walk by. We were hit on all four sides of our table constantly throughout the meal. If staff was not walking by they were basically leaning against our table having conversations with other staff. When it was time to leave, we had to push our way out because the staff was standing over our table and not moving. Would not recommend."

OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 11, 2018",1,Made the reservation and waited an hour and half with no sign of being seated. 15 min plus wait to get a drink while waiting.  Left before eating. Management didn‚Äôt handle the situation properly. This place won‚Äôt last and probably only cool for instagram pictures.
JamieF,"Dined on November 11, 2018",5,Soon as they iron out the kinks this place will be perfect! Food is amazing. Ambiance is great.

Nonna,"Dined on November 11, 2018",1,We never got seated.  Completely ridiculous as a restaurant.
EssEm,"Dined on November 11, 2018",1,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I made reservations for 8 pm and showed up around 7:50. Keep in mind I‚Äôm writing this review at 11:48 pm. As I arrived with my party of 3 I was told they were clearing tables and we would be seated shortly. Several ppl showed up around the same time or a little after and was told the same thing. We checked back in with the host around 8:30 and was given the same robotic response. ‚ÄúWe have diners from 6:30 who just paid but haven‚Äôt gotten up yet‚Äù I watched as many ppl were told the same thing and grew angry as time passed.. Here‚Äôs the way the remainder of the night went:  9:45 pm seated where we placed complete orders 5 mins into being seated. 10:20 we received only one Caesar salad (ordered 2) 10:40 shrimp and lobster dumplings arrived. The owner comes over shortly after with a complimentary salad and dumplings.   We made sure to order main dishes at the same time of ordering appetizers. I expected the wait to be longer, however, by 11:30 we had grown tired of waiting. The owner Stratis Morfogen has to be the rudest person I‚Äôve ever met. He seemed unfazed by me expressing this had been the worst dining experience I‚Äôve ever had. He stated the food would be out in 2 mins. By minute 5 we decided to leave. We were also told we would be reimbursed for one round of drinks. It took them 10 minutes to refund $32, and again, the owner walked away in the middle of me asking why it was taking so long to refund $32. He instead decided to entertain a large party who were having drinks.  With that being said, I‚Äôd rather wait in the lobby of a Red Lobster for over an hour than to ever walk foot back into this overbooked overrated establishment."
MaureenM,"Dined on November 11, 2018",4,"Food was good, service awkward and lacked coordination. Second floor dining area poorly designed for patron and staff traffic flow. We watched people bumping into each other for our entire meal that began at 6:30pm. Owner, Stratis, was there moving things along, but it was still choppy, no pun intended. We will try again in a few months, after the holidays."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 10, 2018",5,Food was fantastic! Service is great! We arrived about an hour earlier than our reservation time and they were able to seat us. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I highly suggest ordering their dumplings. Everything was great.
WestsideAndy,"Dined on November 10, 2018",5,"I decided to have brunch here after getting married at the courthouse just a few blocks north...it was the best decision ever. We both wanted to have lunch in a memorable dining location but not have to deal with an overcrowded and overly noisy location because there was so much we wanted to talk about with our loved ones after our civil ceremony. The manager and owner were so kind and nice, as were the wait staff and hostess. Everyone was great! We cannot wait to celebrate our anniversary here and would refer EVERYONE to dine here because the food is delicious. We will be back many times before our anniversary arrives."
AnnaL,"Dined on November 9, 2018",3,"So I made a reservation for 2 for Thursday night. The place was really busy but we were seated immediately, which was great. Tables for two were placed in the middle of already narrow room so there were waiter walking by us non stop the whole time we were there, which was about 2 hours. Also, the area where waiters congregated was also right next to our table so the swarm of them was walking back and forth and around through the entire evening. I mean, it was great not to wait for water to be refilled and table cleared, but damn! Too many people standing by our table all at the same time was a bit too much. Also, I didn't appreciate when our waiter asked that we order everything, apps and main course, at the same time since ""they were getting really busy"". I wanted another few minutes or so to study what seemed to be an interesting menu, but his insistence threw me off. I didn't like to be rushed, especially if it was my 1st time at this restaurant. By the time we left there were plenty of tables unoccupied, so his comment seemed weird. Now to the food... Philly cheese steak dumplings were fantastic! I really loved the dough; Cesar salad was nothing special and so wasn't my filet mignon sandwich (it said there were supposed to be onions in it and there weren't any..or I just couldn't see or taste them. Also, since I was rushed to make a descision, I didn't see that there was an extra charge for adding cheese. Again, I liked the bready part of the sandwich the most). The highlight of the meal, besides dumplings, was the lava cake. Delicious! Will I be back? Perhaps to try the rest of the dumplings...but then again, I live on UES and probably won't make the trip down town just to visit this spot again."

ZacharyS,"Dined on November 4, 2018",1,"Made a reservation for me and the GF at 9:30pm on Saturday (11/3/18). Got there right at 9:30, told our table wasn't quite ready yet. No problem, place was packed, really cool venue, happy to wait. A few minutes later another couple walks in, and a 2nd host seats them right away. He catches my eye when he comes back, I guess I looked a bit confused, and he says ""you didn't want the table I gave them, very crowded, not a good spot, we're going to get you guys a much better table."" Sure, ok, bit weird to condemn anything about a newly opened establishment you work in, but I figured I'd take his word for it. A good 10 minutes later, the hostess tells us to follow her, takes us upstairs to back of the restaurant, and stops, because there are no open tables to seat us. She apologizes, brings us back downstairs, parks us by the server's entrance to the bar, and disappears. Close to 15 minutes pass, and she reemerges and says ""sorry, they're having coffee, and then we'll seat you,"" and then she disappears again. Doesn't offer us menus, doesn't offer even a drink while we wait, just vanishes again. At least another 10 minutes go by, and she finally comes back with menus, brings us back upstairs, and seats us AT THE TABLE RIGHT BEHIND THE COUPLE WHOSE TABLE ""WE DIDN'T WANT"" WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED. The bus boys are still cleaning the table, putting down silverware, etc...when we sit. Hostess leaves menus, and walks away. A waiter shows up, doesn't introduce himself, and asks ""what do you want to drink?"" We were never given drink menus, which we informed him of. He goes ""oh"", and comes back with ONE drink menu. He leaves, only to come back 30 seconds later and ask again ""what do you want to drink?"" I told him we only got one drink menu, so we weren't ready yet, and he goes ""oh"", brings us a 2nd drink menu, and then leaves. And never comes back. We sat for 15 minutes, and no one ever came back to take our order. So we left."
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 3, 2018",5,This place was GREAT! Outstanding service from the time i walked in the door the host was very tentative and the bartenders as well. The food was like wow. I was impressed with the asian/american fusion. The cheesesteak dumplings!! AMAZING!! only thing we didn't like was our waiter was a little confused seemed like he had too many tables and had a little trouble with english. But everything else was so good along with the experience that it was a pleasure. We will surely return.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on November 3, 2018",5,Excellent place. Cool staff. Great vibe
TinaCrownHeights,"Dined on November 3, 2018",1,"They kept us 20 minutes past our reservation time. (We learned from other diners that Open Table is not accurate.) We waited another 30 minutes before they took our order. We waited 20 minutes for our drinks and 45 minutes for our meal to arrive.  The house salad had no dressing. The Spicy Tuna roll was chewy. And the rare filet arrived well-done on a sizzling platter. We need to relieve the babysitter, so once the food arrived, asked for the check, which we received 15 minutes later. In addition to the slow service and the incorrect food items, the wait staff was noncommunicative and aggressively rude. We asked to check on our order and he reviewed his notepad to read back what we'd ordered, saying ""it's on its way."" That's not checking. To top it off, as we sat there at an empty table waiting, the managers (I think) kept asking ""everything ok?"" to the point where my husband said ""No, we've been waiting sitting at this table for over an hour and don't have our food yet."" We won't return."

I'd like to go back again soon."
Lewie,"Dined on October 30, 2018",5,"We live within 4 blocks in downtown NYC.  We were greeted warmly by Caleb and seated with Daniel. The service and attention was great.  Tried the French onion soup dumplings and the ribs. Dumpling was as anticipated, very nice.  Ribs were perfect for 2.  Had the chicken in black bean sauce which was succulent and satisfying along with shrimp fried rice for 2.  Overall we are happy a restaurant like this is here in our neighborhood!"
DanielG,"Dined on October 29, 2018",2,Average food. Poor service. Staff was not attentive despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy. Bad attitude to top it off. 20% tip added by default. Smart move because otherwise they would not get many tips.

Parker705,"Dined on October 26, 2018",3,"I was glad to discover this place and I will definitely try it again.  I found the service and menu to be a little confused.  For example their salads come in a wooden serving bowl placed on the table with one utensil (a large spoon) with which to serve yourself.    It is awkward and why go to this additional step?  Eventually salad dressing was provided for me, several tasty kinds, but with no explanation of what kinds they were.   Was I supposed to taste them to determine?  (which is what I ended up doing)  My friends' salad arrived dressed.  This is a small matter but it irks me when concept preempts practicality."

The service was excellent and the food is really great and creative and delicious. Not too pricey for the quality. We had several of the offerings from the Chinese inspired part of the menu as well as a delicious piece of perfectly seared filet minion sliced and served with rice.  Drinks were great and the owner Stratis is such a gentleman. He was on the floor all night making sure all of his customers are happy and that the food is good and that the servers are taking care of you.  It's impressive to see the owner also operating as the floor manager and adding his personal touch. The menu may seem a little eclectic, but the dishes are a good complement each other very well. I will definitely go back and recommend to others. Try it!"

RobinR,"Dined on October 20, 2018",1,"We were excited to welcome a newcomer to the neighborhood but were bitterly disappointed.  The food was skimpy, tasteless, and unimaginative -- for example, browning iceberg lettuce for the house salad.  Our waiter was exorbitantly dilatory, and basically disappeared for the bizarrely long periods between servings.  The entrees did not come as described (missing onion, etc.); it was impossible to remedy these deficiencies in our orders because of the waiter's vanishing act. Our wine and cocktails were unremarkable.  The bill was ridiculous given the quantity and quality of the food we finally did receive.  It's supposed to be a chophouse but even the hamburger (two thin paddies) tasted like it was just defrosted.  The waiter never asked what type of salad dressing we wanted but brought out little tin cups for the table with indistinguishable fatty dressings we wouldn't have chosen.  One of our party requested oil and vinegar, and fifteen minutes later, he arrived with two tiny saucers.  The futility of getting his attention again made it too daunting to get more for the others who also wanted oil and vinegar but couldn't share in the minuscule portion.  This, when they're charging $50 for a steak.  We eat out frequently, and have lived in the neighborhood for ten years.  We especially love steakhouses and we have a lot of favorite local places.  But at the end of the evening at the Brooklyn Chop House, I felt the experience was disgusting to the point of false advertising. As far as me and my husband are concerned, they can't go out of business soon enough."

Manhattanknight,"Dined on October 18, 2018",4,"What a bizarre place. We spent most of the time just laughing about the menu offerings. Pac Man Seafood was a hit! the Bacon Cheeseburger Dumplings were...strange. The steaks were perfect though - but the onion ""side"" was a lot more like a ""pay a lot for a garnish"". It was all just entirely amusing, including the rather novice seeming staff which fell over themselves trying to take away everyone's plates. We loved it for the hilarious conversation if nothing else - and the atmosphere is wonderful. Yeah, I'd go back!"

We had the beef rib bao buns,lamb chops , chicken satay, and soft shell crab fried rice.(no complaints) The owner was close friends with biggie smalls (trust when u go, u will be able to tell)"

Person,"Dined on October 8, 2018",3,"Great food, great meat. A little ghetto both in ambiance and patronage. The waiter approached the table on average every 5 min, but much more at the beginning (like every 3 min). We felt rushed and ended up making quick decisions on food just to try to keep him away for a little bit. Overall it's a good place for people watching (the partons), and great steak/dumplings. I wouldn't recommend it if you're attempting to impress someone who's at all refined, or if you are yourself (I was embarrassed to have made the recommendation). BUT, the food was really good, and now knowing what it is, I'd go back by myself, maybe at a time where it's probably not going to be busy."

HarryH,"Dined on October 7, 2018",5,I had one of the best steaks I've ever had there - the Porterhouse for 2...and great to pair it with healthier Asian style veggie options rather than the typical potatoes...thanks Brooklyn Chop House!
WhitneyB,"Dined on October 7, 2018",2,"Was very excited to try this as I live down the street and am always looking for great new go-to spots. Food was extremely average and service was dismal-getting drinks was like waiting for snow to melt and our server forgot several things when they finally did show up. Ambiance is also very odd, a friend told me it used to be a Denny‚Äôs prior to becoming BCH and I 100% believe that. Highly suggest skipping."
JenniferB,"Dined on October 7, 2018",4,Unique menu offering a variety of Asian/steakhouse fusion with a multitude of options...from French onion soup dumplings to short ribs to seafood. Great variety and cannot wait to return to try additional items
katiem,"Dined on October 7, 2018",5,We walked in and loved what we saw already! They have a nice bar area where people can hangout with a cocktail and relax. I loved everything we ordered and our waiter was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed! We will definitely be going back asap!! Its our new to-go- to place!!
RALRSL,"Dined on October 6, 2018",2,Mediocre at best! Dissapointing waited for opening and once opened very disappointed.  Unusual menu for restaurant with chop house in name! Should decide what it wants to be when it grows up. The side room at lower level is also terrible if you go sit upstairs.
OpenTable Diner,"Dined on October 5, 2018",5,"The entire dining experience was amazing. The restaurants decor is beautiful, the customer service was on point, the drinks & dinner were impeccable. I‚Äôll definitely be back very soon!! I can see this restaurant doing well and being open for years to come!! Thank you Brooklyn Chop House!"
MerisZ,"Dined on October 3, 2018",4,"Service was very friendly and helpful. A little slow as waiter was dealing with multiple tables.  Food was fun; we had dim sum. Wine very good.  Didn‚Äôt care for the pac man dumplings.  However, the pork soup dumplings were delicious. As it is steps from my apt building, I will be a frequent guest.  I don‚Äôt want to forget mentioning that my grandson loved his caramel ice cream with caramel sauce; whipped cream wasn‚Äôt good.  Looking forward to my next visit where I plan on trying one of your meat or fish entrees. So happy that you are here!"
